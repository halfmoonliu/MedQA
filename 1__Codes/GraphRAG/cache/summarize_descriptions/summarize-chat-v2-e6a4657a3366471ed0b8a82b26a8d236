{"result": "RANDOMIZATION is the process of assigning patients or study participants to different groups in a clinical trial or study. This is done using random methods, such as computer-generated permuted blocks, to ensure an unbiased distribution of participants across various treatment or study groups. The primary goal of randomization is to reduce bias and ensure that the results of the study are reliable and valid. By randomly assigning participants, researchers can achieve an unbiased distribution, which is crucial for the integrity of the trial's outcomes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
