{"result": "The Surviving Sepsis Campaign is an initiative aimed at reducing mortality in patients with sepsis and septic shock. One of the key strategies endorsed by the campaign is Early Goal-Directed Therapy (EGDT), which is specifically designed to decrease mortality in patients suffering from septic shock.
