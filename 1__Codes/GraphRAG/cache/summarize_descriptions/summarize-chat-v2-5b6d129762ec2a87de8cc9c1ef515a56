{"result": "Drotrecogin Alfa Activated is a therapeutic agent known for its ability to reduce plasma D-Dimer levels. This reduction in D-Dimer levels indicates a decrease in thrombin generation, showcasing the biologic activity of Drotrecogin Alfa Activated. By decreasing D-Dimer levels, Drotrecogin Alfa Activated effectively demonstrates its role in modulating coagulation processes.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
