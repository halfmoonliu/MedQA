{"result": "Kaplanâ€“Meier curves are a statistical method used to estimate survival probabilities over time. They are commonly employed in studies to assess the probability of survival over a given period. This method is often used in conjunction with a log-rank test to compare survival estimates between different groups.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
