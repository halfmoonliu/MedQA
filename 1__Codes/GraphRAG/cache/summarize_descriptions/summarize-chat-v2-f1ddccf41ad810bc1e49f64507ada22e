{"result": "Fludrocortisone is a synthetic corticosteroid and mineralocorticoid used in combination with hydrocortisone in various clinical trials, including the APROCCHSS trial and the Annane study, to treat conditions such as septic shock and adrenal insufficiency. In these studies, it was administered as a daily dose of 50 μg orally. Despite its use in these trials, fludrocortisone was previously shown to be ineffective in the context of the specific trial mentioned. It was also compared against a placebo in the study to evaluate its efficacy.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
