Patients were excluded if they had hypoxemia primarily related to left atrial hypertension, suspected vasculitic pulmonary hemorrhage, neuromuscular disorders that are known to prolong the need for mechanical ventilation, severe chronic respiratory disease, or preexisting conditions with an expected 6-month mortality exceeding 50%; if they were at risk for intracranial hypertension; if there was a lack of commitment to life support; if the expected duration of mechanical ventilation was less than 48 hours; if they were younger than 16 years of age or older than 85 years of age; or if their weight was less than 35 kg or more than 1 kg per centimeter of height. We did not enroll patients who had already met the eligibility criteria for more than 72 hours, those who were already receiving HFOV, or those whose physicians declined to enroll them.\nAfter enrollment, standardized ventilator settings were used for all the patients: pressure-control mode, a tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram, and an FiO2 of 0.60 with a PEEP level of 10 cm of water or higher if needed for oxygenation. After 30 minutes, if the PaO2:FiO2 ratio remained at 200 or lower, patients underwent randomization; otherwise the standardized ventilator settings were maintained, and the patients were reassessed at least once daily for up to 72 hours. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the HFOV group or to the conventional-ventilation group. Randomization was performed in undisclosed block sizes of 2 and 4 with the use of a central Web-based randomization system, stratified according to center. All patients or their legal surrogates provided written informed consent for participation in the study.\nHFOV Protocol\nThe HFOV protocol was designed on the basis of the results of pilot testing and consensus guidelines.24,27 We first conducted a recruitment maneuver, by applying 40 cm of water pressure for 40 seconds to the airway opening in an effort to reopen closed lung units. We then initiated HFOV with a mean airway pressure of 30 cm of water, adjusting the pressure thereafter according to the protocol, targeting a PaO2 of 55 to 80 mm Hg (Table 1 and Table 2). We minimized HFOV tidal volumes by using the highest possible frequency that would maintain arterial blood pH above 7.25.13,28\nTable 1\n\nVentilator Protocols.\nTable 2\n\nUsual Combinations of the Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2) and Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) or Mean Airway Pressure Used to Adjust Ventilators.\nAfter 24 hours of HFOV, conventional ventilation could be resumed if the mean airway pressure was 24 cm of water or less for 12 hours. This transition was mandatory when airway pressures reached 20 cm of water. Thereafter, mechanical ventilation followed the control protocol. Over the next 48 hours, if an FiO2 of more than 0.4 or a PEEP level of more than 14 cm of water was required for more than 1 hour to achieve oxygenation targets, HFOV was resumed.\nControl Ventilation Protocol\nThe control ventilation protocol, which was adapted from an earlier trial,9 called for a target tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram, with plateau airway pressure of 35 cm of water or less and high levels of PEEP. After an initial recruitment maneuver (the same as that used for the HFOV group), clinicians applied ventilation using pressure-control mode with a PEEP level of 20 cm of water and then adjusted the PEEP level and the FiO2 according to the protocol (Table 1 and Table 2). The protocol permitted the use of volume-assist control mode or pressure-support mode with the same limits for tidal volumes and airway pressures. For patients receiving pressure support with PEEP levels of 10 cm of water or less and an FiO2 of 0.4 or less, there were no limits on tidal volume or airway pressures. The weaning protocol, which has been published previously, included daily trials of spontaneous breathing.9,29\nProcedures in Both Groups\nWhen hypoxemia persisted despite increases in PEEP or mean airway pressure, or when, on the basis of radiographic or clinical evidence, physicians judged that the lungs were over-distended, they could reduce PEEP or mean airway pressure to a level below that indicated in the assigned protocol (Table 2).\nFor patients with hypoxemia who required an FiO2 of 0.9 or greater, clinicians could institute therapies for hypoxemia (e.g., prone positioning or inhaled nitric oxide) that did not interfere with the assigned ventilator protocols. Physicians could institute any alternative therapy (including HFOV in the control group) for patients who met any one of the following criteria: refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 <60 mm Hg for 1 hour with an FiO2 of 1.0 and neuromuscular blockade), refractory barotrauma (persistent pneumoth\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
