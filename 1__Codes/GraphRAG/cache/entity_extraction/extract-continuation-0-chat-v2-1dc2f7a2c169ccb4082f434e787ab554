Hemodynamic management was started within 2 hours after catheter insertion and continued for seven days or until 12 hours after a patient was able to breathe without assistance.14 After day 3, a pulmonary-artery catheter could be replaced by a central venous catheter if hemodynamic stability (i.e., absence of the need for protocol-directed interventions on the basis of a measurement with a pulmonary-artery catheter for more than 24 hours) was achieved. We monitored compliance with protocol instructions twice each day: once during a morning reference period and again at a randomly selected time. A 100 percent audit of all instructions conducted after the first 82 patients were enrolled showed rates of protocol compliance similar to those obtained during the random checks (data not shown).\nStudy personnel underwent training in the conduct of the protocol (Figure 1) and the measurement of vascular pressure. Vascular pressures were measured in supine patients at end expiration (identified with an airway pressure signal) but were not adjusted for airway pressure.15\nFigure 1\n\nOverview of the Protocol for Conservative and Liberal Fluid Management in the Group Assigned to a Pulmonary-Artery Catheter (PAC) and the Group Assigned to a Central Venous Catheter (CVC).\nSubjects\nA National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute protocol-review committee, a data and safety monitoring board, and the institutional review board of each participating hospital approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from participants or legally authorized surrogates. The data and safety monitoring board conducted interim analyses after the enrollment of 82 patients and then after the enrollment of approximately every 200 patients. Sequential stopping rules for safety and efficacy used the method of O'Brien and Fleming.16\nOrgan Failure\nFor 28 days, we monitored patients daily for cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic failure; coagulation abnormalities; and the need for assisted ventilation.14 The severity of lung injury was scored according to the method of Murray et al.17; the scores can range from 0 to 4, with a lower score indicating better lung function.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe study had a statistical power of 90 percent to detect a reduction by 10 percentage points (from 31 percent to 21 percent) in the primary end point, death before discharge home during the first 60 days after randomization, with the planned enrollment of 1000 patients. We assumed patients who went home without the use of assisted ventilation before day 60 were alive at 60 days. Data on patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or in a hospital were censored on the last day of follow-up. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the mean (±SE) 60-day mortality rate at the time of the last death that occurred before 60 days. Differences in mortality between the groups were assessed by a z test. The primary analysis was conducted according to the intention to treat. We assessed differences in continuous variables with analysis of variance, differences in categorical variables with a Mantel–Haenszel test, and differences between continuous variables over time with repeated-measures analysis of variance. For continuous variables, means ±SE are reported. Two-sided P values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance. We used SAS software (version 8.2, SAS Institute) for the analysis.\nResults\nEnrollment and Exclusions\nWe screened patients at 20 North American centers between June 8, 2000, and October 3, 2005. The trial was halted on July 25, 2002, for a review by the Office of Human Research Protection and resumed unchanged on July 23, 2003, except for the introduction of a modified consent form.18–20 Figure 2 shows the most common reasons for exclusion for the 10,511 patients who were screened but not enrolled and the follow-up for the 503 patients who were randomly assigned to conservative fluid management and the 498 who were assigned to liberal fluid management (all reasons for exclusion are listed in Table 1 of the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nEnrollment and Outcomes.\nBaseline Characteristics\nThe two groups were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, type of intensive care unit (ICU), cause of lung injury, coexisting illnesses, severity of illness, organ function, fluid balance before the study began, vasopressor use, and presence of shock (Table 1).\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics.\nProtocol Conduct and Instructions\nThe mean time from admission to the ICU to the first protocol instruction was 41.3±1.6 hours in the liberal-strategy group and 43.8±2.5 hours in the conservative-strategy group (P=0.42). The rate of compliance with instructions was similar in the two groups (91 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 88 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.06), even though patients in the former group received more protocol instructions per day (5.1 vs. 4.1, P<0.001). Patients in the conservative-strategy group received furosemide more frequently than did patients in the liberal-strategy group (41 percent vs. 10 percent of instructions, P<0.001), whereas patients in the latter group more often received a fluid bolus (15 percent vs. 6 percent of instructions, P<0.001). More furosemide was given to the conservative-strategy group (Table 2). Dobutamine use was similar and uncommon in both groups (4 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 6 percent in the conservative-strategy group). At least one blood transfusion was given to 29 percent of patients in the conservative-str\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is a U.S. government agency that funds and conducts research related to heart, lung, and blood diseases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OFFICE OF HUMAN RESEARCH PROTECTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Office of Human Research Protection is a U.S. government office responsible for ensuring the protection of human subjects in research)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NORTH AMERICAN CENTERS<|>GEO<|>The 20 centers in North America where the study was conducted)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNE 8, 2000<|>EVENT<|>The start date of the patient screening for the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OCTOBER 3, 2005<|>EVENT<|>The end date of the patient screening for the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULY 25, 2002<|>EVENT<|>The date when the trial was halted for review by the Office of Human Research Protection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULY 23, 2003<|>EVENT<|>The date when the trial resumed after being halted)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE<|>OFFICE OF HUMAN RESEARCH PROTECTION<|>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's study was reviewed by the Office of Human Research Protection<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NORTH AMERICAN CENTERS<|>NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE<|>The study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute was conducted at 20 North American centers<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUNE 8, 2000<|>NORTH AMERICAN CENTERS<|>Patient screening for the study began at North American centers on June 8, 2000<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OCTOBER 3, 2005<|>NORTH AMERICAN CENTERS<|>Patient screening for the study ended at North American centers on October 3, 2005<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULY 25, 2002<|>OFFICE OF HUMAN RESEARCH PROTECTION<|>The trial was halted for review by the Office of Human Research Protection on July 25, 2002<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULY 23, 2003<|>OFFICE OF HUMAN RESEARCH PROTECTION<|>The trial resumed on July 23, 2003, after review by the Office of Human Research Protection<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
