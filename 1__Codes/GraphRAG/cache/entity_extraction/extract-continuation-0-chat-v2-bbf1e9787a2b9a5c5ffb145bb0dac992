However, the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the number of patients given at least one open-label cisatracurium bolus during the entire ICU stay after enrollment (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The required dose of sedatives or analgesics was similar in the two groups during the first week of the study (Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSafety\nBradycardia developed during the cisatracurium infusion in one patient. No other side effects were reported.\nDiscussion\nTreatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for 48 hours early in the course of severe ARDS improved the adjusted 90-day survival rate, increased the numbers of ventilator-free days and days outside the ICU, and decreased the incidence of barotrauma during the first 90 days. It did not significantly improve the overall 90-day mortality.\nStrengths of this trial include the methods used to minimize bias (blinded randomization assignments, a well-defined study protocol, complete follow-up, and intention-to-treat analyses). The recruitment of a large number of patients from 20 multidisciplinary ICUs where international standards of care are followed suggests that our data can be generalized to other ICUs.\nLimitations of the trial include the fact that our results were obtained for cisatracurium besylate and may not apply to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Furthermore, we did not assess the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent late in the course of ARDS or use on the basis of plateau-pressure or transpulmonary-pressure measurements.20 Another limitation is the absence of data on conditions known to antagonize or potentiate neuromuscular blockade. However, any condition that increases the duration of neuromuscular blockade would have adversely affected the patients receiving the neuromuscular blocking agent, in particular by increasing the duration of mechanical ventilation.\nThe sample-size calculation was based on our two previous studies performed in four ICUs13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria as were used in the current trial and on the European epidemiologic study ALIVE.4 However, the mortality in the placebo group in this study (40.7%) is lower than that in the control groups in the earlier studies. Given the observed mortality in our placebo group, the current study was underpowered. Indeed, 885 patients would have been needed to be enrolled to achieve 80% statistical power with a two-sided alpha value of 0.05.\nFinally, all our patients had severe ARDS. Additional work is needed to determine whether the use of neuromuscular blocking agents for only 24 hours is beneficial in selected patients. In our general analysis, which was prespecified but with post hoc determination of the threshold value for classifying subgroups, we found that the beneficial effect of the neuromuscular blocking agent on survival was confined to the two thirds of patients with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio below 120.\nThe mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of neuromuscular blocking agents remain speculative. A brief period of paralysis early in the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective mechanical ventilation by improving patient–ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels, thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony-related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar-pressure increases with overdistention. Another possible mechanism of the benefit involves a decrease in lung or systemic inflammation.15\nThe main safety concern with the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weakness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and rocuronium) may carry the highest risk of myopathy,23 although myopathy has also been reported with benzylisoquinolines, including cisatracurium besylate.24,25 Muscle weakness was not increased significantly by the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent in our study. The short duration of use of the neuromuscular blocking agent probably explains this result.\nIn conclusion, this multicenter trial provides evidence that the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent early in the course of severe ARDS managed with low-tidal-volume ventilation may improve outcomes. Future studies are needed to replicate and expand these findings before they can be widely adopted in clinical practice.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CISATRACURIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cisatracurium is a neuromuscular blocking agent used in the treatment of severe ARDS to improve survival rates and reduce barotrauma)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARDS<|>EVENT<|>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a severe lung condition that requires intensive care and mechanical ventilation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ICU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intensive Care Unit, a specialized department in hospitals where critically ill patients receive care)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALIVE<|>EVENT<|>European epidemiologic study that provided data for sample-size calculation in the trial)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CISATRACURIUM<|>ARDS<|>Cisatracurium is used as a treatment to improve outcomes in patients with severe ARDS<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CISATRACURIUM<|>ICU<|>Cisatracurium was administered to patients in 20 multidisciplinary ICUs following international standards of care<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ICU<|>ARDS<|>Patients with severe ARDS were treated in the ICU<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALIVE<|>ICU<|>The ALIVE study provided data that influenced the sample-size calculation for the trial conducted in ICUs<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
