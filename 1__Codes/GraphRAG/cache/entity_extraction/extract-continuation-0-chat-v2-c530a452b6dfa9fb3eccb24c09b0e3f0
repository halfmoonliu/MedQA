The primary outcome was the rate of in-hospital death from any cause.\nResults\nOn the recommendation of the data monitoring committee, we stopped the trial after 548 of a planned 1200 patients had undergone randomization. The two study groups were well matched at baseline. The HFOV group underwent HFOV for a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 2 to 8); in addition, 34 of 273 patients (12%) in the control group received HFOV for refractory hypoxemia. In-hospital mortality was 47% in the HFOV group, as compared with 35% in the control group (relative risk of death with HFOV, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.64; P=0.005). This finding was independent of baseline abnormalities in oxygenation or respiratory compliance. Patients in the HFOV group received higher doses of midazolam than did patients in the control group (199 mg per day [interquartile range, 100 to 382] vs. 141 mg per day [interquartile range, 68 to 240], P<0.001), and more patients in the HFOV group than in the control group received neuromuscular blockers (83% vs. 68%, P<0.001). In addition, more patients in the HFOV group received vasoactive drugs (91% vs. 84%, P=0.01) and received them for a longer period than did patients in the control group (5 days vs. 3 days, P=0.01).\nConclusions\nIn adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV, as compared with a ventilation strategy of low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure, does not reduce, and may increase, in-hospital mortality. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Current Controlled Trials numbers, ISRCTN42992782 and ISRCTN87124254, and ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT00474656 and NCT01506401.)\nThe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication of critical illness.1,2 Mortality is high, and survivors often have long-term complications.3,4 Although mechanical ventilation is life-sustaining for patients with ARDS, it can perpetuate lung injury. Basic research suggests that repetitive overstretching or collapse of lung units with each respiratory cycle can generate local and systemic inflammation, contributing to multiorgan failure and death.5 Consistent with these findings are data from clinical trials that support the use of smaller tidal volumes (6 vs. 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight)6 and higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP).7–10 Mortality remains high, however, and additional therapies are needed to protect the lung in cases of severe ARDS.11,12\nOne such approach is high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), which delivers very small tidal volumes (approximately 1 to 2 ml per kilogram13) at very high rates (3 to 15 breaths per second).14–19 Previous randomized trials of the use of HFOV in adults with ARDS have suggested that this strategy results in improvements in oxygenation and survival, but the trials were limited by small sample sizes and outdated ventilation strategies for the control group.20–22 Consequently, despite the frequent use of HFOV in patients who do not have an adequate response to conventional mechanical ventilation and the increased use of HFOV earlier in the course of the disease, this approach remains an unproven therapy for adults with ARDS.23–26 We therefore compared HFOV with a conventional ventilation strategy that used low tidal volumes and high levels of PEEP in patients with new-onset, moderate-to-severe ARDS.\nMethods\nStudy Oversight\nFor the pilot phase of the study, we enrolled patients at 11 centers in Canada and 1 in Saudi Arabia from July 2007 through June 2008; for the main trial, we enrolled patients at the same centers and at an additional 27 centers in Canada, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Chile, and India from July 2009 through August 2012 (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The trial protocol, which is available at NEJM.org, was approved by the research ethics board at each participating site.
