Written informed consent had to be obtained from the patients themselves or their relatives and a short corticotropin test had to be performed before randomization. Finally, patients had to be randomized within 3 hours of the onset of shock.\n\nPatients were excluded if they were pregnant or had evidence for acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, advanced form of cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection, and contraindication or formal indication for corticosteroids.\n\nDuring recruitment, we refined the eligibility criteria by not making the arterial lactate requirement mandatory (the 6th criterion) but adding it as an option to the 5th criterion. We also increased the maximum delay from the onset of septic shock and randomization from 3 to 8 hours (amendment of July 18, 1996); and we excluded patients who received etomidate during the 6 hours preceding randomization because it is a selective inhibitor of the 11 β-hydroxylase and therefore could interfere with cortisol response to corticotropin (amendment of June 19, 1997).\n\nRandomization\nRandomization was centrally performed, concealed, and stratified by center in blocks of 4 according to a computer-generated random number table. In each center, sequentially numbered boxes containing the whole treatment for each patient were delivered to the investigator by the pharmacist following the order of the randomization list. All patients, medical and nursing staffs, and pharmacists remained blinded throughout the study period.\n\nTreatments\nHydrocortisone came in vials containing 100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules containing 2 mL of glucose solution solvent, which was administered intravenously every 6 hours as a 50-mg bolus (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France). One tablet containing 50 µg of 9-α-fludrocortisone was administered daily through a nasogastric tube with 10 to 40 mL of water over 30 seconds (Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux, Paris, France). Placebos were indiscernible from active treatments. Treatment duration was 7 days.\n\nData Collection at Inclusion\nClinical Evaluation\nThe following data were recorded: (1) general characteristics including estimated prognosis of any underlying disease17 and level of activity limitation18; (2) severity of illness assessed by vital signs, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II),19 and Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score20; and (3) interventions including the volume of fluid infusion and the type and doses of vasopressors and antibiotics.\n\nLaboratory Variables\nHematological and chemistry data, arterial lactate and blood gas determinations, and blood cultures and cultures of specimen drawn from the site of infection were done systematically. The short corticotropin test was performed using a 250-µg intravenous bolus of tetracosactrin (Synacthène Ciba, Rueil-Malmaison, France). Blood samples were taken immediately before the test and 30 and 60 minutes after the test. After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at −80°C until assayed. Cortisol was measured blindly and serially before interim and final statistical analyses using Immunotech radioimmunoassay.21 To reduce heterogeneity in cortisol determination, all plasma samples were measured at a central laboratory. Cortisol response was defined as the difference between the highest of the concentrations taken after the test and those taken before the test. Relative adrenal insufficiency (ie, nonresponders) was defined by a response of 9 µg/dL or less.7,8\n\nFollow-up\nThe following data were recorded daily during the 28-day period following randomization: vital signs, results from standard laboratory tests and cultures of specimen drawn from any new site of infection, and interventions. In addition, the patient's status at discharge from ICU and hospital and 1 year after randomization was recorded.\n\nEnd Points\nThe main end point was the 28-day survival distribution from randomization in nonresponders to the short corticotropin test. Secondary end points were 28-day survival distributions from randomization in responders to the short corticotropin test and in all patients; 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates; and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal during the 28 days from randomization in the 2 subsets of patients and in all patients.\n\nAdverse events were carefully monitored and classified as being possibly related to corticosteroids (superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric disorders), possibly related to vasopress\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ROUSSEL-UCLAF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Roussel-Uclaf is a pharmaceutical company based in Romainville, France, responsible for producing hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder used in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHARMACIE CENTRALE DES HÔPITAUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux is a pharmacy in Paris, France, that provided 9-α-fludrocortisone tablets for the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYNATCHÈNE CIBA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Synacthène Ciba is a pharmaceutical product used for the short corticotropin test, produced by Ciba)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IMMUNOTECH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Immunotech is a company that provided the radioimmunoassay used for measuring cortisol levels in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRANCE<|>GEO<|>France is the country where the study was conducted, involving pharmaceutical companies and hospitals)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JULY 18, 1996<|>EVENT<|>Date of an amendment to the study protocol, changing the criteria for randomization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUNE 19, 1997<|>EVENT<|>Date of an amendment to the study protocol, excluding patients who received etomidate)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROUSSEL-UCLAF<|>PHARMACIE CENTRALE DES HÔPITAUX<|>Both organizations provided pharmaceutical products for the study<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ROUSSEL-UCLAF<|>FRANCE<|>Roussel-Uclaf is based in France and participated in the study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHARMACIE CENTRALE DES HÔPITAUX<|>FRANCE<|>Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux is located in France and participated in the study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYNATCHÈNE CIBA<|>FRANCE<|>Synacthène Ciba was used in the study conducted in France<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IMMUNOTECH<|>FRANCE<|>Immunotech provided assays for the study conducted in France<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JULY 18, 1996<|>FRANCE<|>The amendment to the study protocol occurred in France<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUNE 19, 1997<|>FRANCE<|>The amendment to the study protocol occurred in France<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
