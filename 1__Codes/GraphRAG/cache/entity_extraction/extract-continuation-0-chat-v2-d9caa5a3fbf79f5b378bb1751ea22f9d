However, adoption has been limited, and uncertainty about its effectiveness remains.\nMethods\nWe conducted a pragmatic randomized trial with an integrated cost-effectiveness analysis in 56 hospitals in England. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either EGDT (a 6-hour resuscitation protocol) or usual care. The primary clinical outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days.\nResults\nWe enrolled 1260 patients, with 630 assigned to EGDT and 630 to usual care. By 90 days, 184 of 623 patients (29.5%) in the EGDT group and 181 of 620 patients (29.2%) in the usual-care group had died (relative risk in the EGDT group, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.20; P=0.90), for an absolute risk reduction in the EGDT group of −0.3 percentage points (95% CI, −5.4 to 4.7). Increased treatment intensity in the EGDT group was indicated by increased use of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions and reflected by significantly worse organ-failure scores, more days receiving advanced cardiovascular support, and longer stays in the intensive care unit. There were no significant differences in any other secondary outcomes, including health-related quality of life, or in rates of serious adverse events. On average, EGDT increased costs, and the probability that it was cost-effective was below 20%.\nConclusions\nIn patients with septic shock who were identified early and received intravenous antibiotics and adequate fluid resuscitation, hemodynamic management according to a strict EGDT protocol did not lead to an improvement in outcome. (Funded by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme; ProMISe Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN36307479.)\nThe incidence of severe sepsis and septic shock in adults is estimated to range from 56 to 91 per 100,000 population per year.1 Affected patients have high rates of death, complications, and resource utilization.2–5\nSince 2002, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) has promoted best practice, including early recognition, source control, appropriate and timely antibiotic administration, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs.6–8 Resuscitation guidance is largely based on a 2001 single-center, proof-of-concept study by Rivers et al., which indicated that protocolized delivery of 6 hours of early, goal-directed therapy (EGDT) to patients presenting to the emergency department with early septic shock reduced hospital mortality and hospital stay.9 Such therapy aims to optimize tissue oxygen transport with the use of continuous monitoring of prespecified physiological targets — central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) — to guide delivery of intravenous fluids, vasoactive drugs, and red-cell transfusions.\nHowever, despite the SSC recommendations, the adoption of EGDT has been limited, with concern about the external validity of results from a single center, the complexity of delivery, the potential risks of the components, and resources required for implementation.10,11\nTo address these concerns, multicenter trials of EGDT were conducted in the United States (Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock [ProCESS] trial),12 Australasia (Australasian Resuscitation in Sepsis Evaluation [ARISE] trial),13 and England (Protocolised Management in Sepsis [ProMISe] trial). In all three trials, harmonized methods14 were used to permit subsequent meta-analysis of data from individual patients.15 The two published studies12,13 reported no benefit for EGDT. However, both reported lower-than-anticipated mortality, with a 60-day in-hospital mortality of 18.9% (as compared with an anticipated rate of 30 to 46%) in the ProCESS trial and 90-day mortality of 18.8% (as compared with an anticipated rate of 38%) in the ARISE trial. Consequently, neither trial could rule out the potential for a 20% relative reduction in 90-day mortality for EGDT, as compared with usual care, with a relative risk of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.15) in the ProCESS trial and a relative risk of 0.98 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.21) in the ARISE trial. We based sample-size calculations for the ProMISe study on a relative risk reduction of 20%.\nThe ProMISe study, which was conducted in a setting in which the reported mortality for septic shock is high and was designed with an integrated economic evaluation, tested the hypothesis that the 6-hour EGDT resuscitation protocol is superior, in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness measures, to usual care in patients presenting with early septic shock to National Health Service (NHS) emergency departments in England.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Oversight\nOur study was a pragmatic, open, multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial. The North West London Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) funded the study and convened a trial steering committee and independent data monitoring and ethics committee. The Clinical Trials Unit at the United Kingdom Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) managed the study (for details, see the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org).
