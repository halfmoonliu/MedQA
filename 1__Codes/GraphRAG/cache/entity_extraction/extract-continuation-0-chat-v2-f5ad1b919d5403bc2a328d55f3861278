An independent ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes d’Ile de France XI, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France) approved the trial protocol. Participants or their legally authorized next of kin provided written informed consent before inclusion whenever possible. Otherwise, deferred written informed consent was obtained from patients.\nThis investigator-led trial was publicly funded. Our placebo-controlled trial, conducted with four parallel groups that were organized in a 2-by-2 factorial design, aimed to evaluate the benefits and risks of corticosteroids and drotrecogin alfa (activated) given alone or in combination. After the withdrawal of Xigris from the market in October 2011, the trial continued with two parallel groups. The effects of drotrecogin alfa (activated) have been reported previously14; in the current article, we report on the effects of hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy. All the authors had full and independent access to all data and vouch for the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of the data and analysis and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol.\nTrial Patients\nPatients in intensive care units (ICUs) were eligible for inclusion in the trial if they had indisputable or probable septic shock15 for less than 24 hours. Septic shock was defined as the presence of a clinically or microbiologically documented infection, a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)16 score of 3 or 4 (on a scale of 0 to 4 for each of six organ systems, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction) for at least two organs and at least 6 hours, and receipt of vasopressor therapy (norepinephrine, epinephrine, or any other vasopressor at a dose of ≥0.25 μg per kilogram of body weight per minute or ≥1 mg per hour) for at least 6 hours to maintain a systolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg or a mean blood pressure of at least 65 mm Hg.\nThe exclusion criteria have been detailed elsewhere.13 (See also the trial protocol.) Major exclusion criteria were the presence of septic shock for at least 24 hours, a high risk of bleeding, pregnancy or lactation, underlying conditions that could affect short-term survival, known hypersensitivity to drotrecogin alfa (activated), or previous treatment with corticosteroids. After the withdrawal of Xigris from the market, the exclusion criteria that were relevant only to drotrecogin alfa (activated) were removed.13 (Protocol amendments are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.)\nRandomization and Trial Agents\nPatients were randomly assigned in permuted blocks of eight to receive hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy, drotrecogin alfa (activated), the combination of the three drugs, or their respective placebos. (For more details on randomization, see the protocol.) Hydrocortisone was administered as a 50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours, and fludrocortisone was given as a 50-μg tablet through a nasogastric tube once daily in the morning. Trial agents were administered for 7 days without tapering. Placebos of French commercial forms of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were manufactured for the requirements of the trial. Active agents and placebos had similar appearances (checked and certified by qualified persons for each batch) — that is, vials of white, freeze-dried powder for parenteral use of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate (100 mg) or placebo (mannitol [133.6 mg], disodium phosphate [8.73 mg], and sodium phosphate [0.92 mg]) and tablets of oral fludrocortisone or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose [59.098 mg], magnesium stearate [0.6 mg], and colloidal anhydrous silica [0.3 mg]) in blister packs of 10. The details of administration of drotrecogin alfa (activated) are available in the protocol.\nTrial Measurements and Procedures\nBefore randomization, plasma total cortisol levels were measured before, and 30 and 60 minutes after, an intravenous bolus of 250 μg of corticotropin (Synacthen). The variables that were investigated at baseline and during the 180-day follow-up have been detailed elsewhere.13 Nonexperimental interventions were harmonized across centers according to the 2008 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines,17 including antiinfective treatments, hemodynamic and respiratory management, and blood glucose control. Investigators followed national guidelines for the prevention of superinfection.18 Neuromuscular-blocking agents were discouraged except in the first 24 hours in the presence of refractory hypoxemia. Investigators’ adherence to guidelines was checked at each investigators’ meeting.\nOutcomes\nThe primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, day 28, and day 180; the percentage of patients from whom care was withheld or withdrawn; the percentage of\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APROCCHSS TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>The Activated Protein C and Corticosteroids for Human Septic Shock (APROCCHSS) trial is a clinical study designed to test the effects of hydrocortisone-plus-fludrocortisone therapy and drotrecogin alfa on patients with septic shock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMITÉ DE PROTECTION DES PERSONNES D’ILE DE FRANCE XI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An independent ethics committee based in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, that approved the trial protocol for the APROCCHSS trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAINT-GERMAIN-EN-LAYE<|>GEO<|>A location in France where the ethics committee that approved the APROCCHSS trial is based)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NEJM.ORG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The website where the full text of the APROCCHSS trial article and protocol are available)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XIGRIS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A drug that was withdrawn from the market in October 2011, affecting the continuation of the APROCCHSS trial)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APROCCHSS TRIAL<|>COMITÉ DE PROTECTION DES PERSONNES D’ILE DE FRANCE XI<|>The ethics committee approved the trial protocol for the APROCCHSS trial<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APROCCHSS TRIAL<|>NEJM.ORG<|>The full text and protocol of the APROCCHSS trial are available on NEJM.org<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APROCCHSS TRIAL<|>XIGRIS<|>The withdrawal of Xigris from the market affected the continuation of the APROCCHSS trial<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMITÉ DE PROTECTION DES PERSONNES D’ILE DE FRANCE XI<|>SAINT-GERMAIN-EN-LAYE<|>The ethics committee is based in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
