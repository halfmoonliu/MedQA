The only significant difference between the two groups at baseline was a lower mean PaO2:FIO2 value in the cisatracurium group (P=0.03) (Table 2, and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nOutcomes\nPrimary Outcome\nThe Cox regression model yielded a hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for the baseline PaO2:FIO2, SAPS II, and plateau pressure (Figure 2). The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival through Day 90, According to Study Group.\nSecondary Prespecified Outcomes\nThe beneficial effect of cisatracurium on the 90-day survival rate was confined to the two thirds of patients presenting with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio of less than 120. Among these patients, the 90-day mortality was 30.8% in the cisatracurium group and 44.6% in the control group (P=0.04) (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The absolute difference in 28-day mortality (mortality in the cisatracurium group minus mortality in the placebo group) was −9.6 percentage points (95% CI, −19.2 to −0.2; P=0.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3\n\nSecondary Outcomes, According to Study Group.\nThe cisatracurium group had significantly more ventilator-free days than the placebo group during the first 28 and 90 days (Table 3, and Figure 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The Cox regression model yielded an adjusted hazard ratio for weaning from mechanical ventilation by day 90, in the cisatracurium group as compared with the placebo group, of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.83; P=0.01). The cisatracurium group had more days free of failure of organs, other than the lungs, during the first 28 days (15.8±9.9 days, vs. 12.2±11.1 days in the placebo group; P=0.01). There were nearly significant between-group differences in the numbers of days without coagulation abnormalities, hepatic failure, and renal failure (Table 3). No patient required dialysis after hospital discharge during the first 28 days. Significantly more days were spent outside the ICU between day 1 and day 90 in the cisatracurium group.\nPneumothorax occurred in a larger proportion of patients in the placebo group (11.7%, vs. 4.0% in the cisatracurium group; P=0.01) and tended to develop earlier in the placebo group (Figure 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the 48-hour period of study-drug infusion, pneumothorax occurred in one patient (0.6%) in the cisatracurium group as compared with eight patients (4.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.03). The plateau pressures and minute ventilations for the nine patients are presented in Table 5 in the Supplementary Appendix. Before the development of pneumothorax, none of these patients had an elevated plateau pressure necessitating changes in the mechanical-ventilation settings, changes in the sedation regimen, or open-label administration of cisatracurium.\nThe incidence of ICU-acquired paresis, as evaluated on the basis of the MRC score on day 28 or at the time of ICU discharge, did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 3).\nSecondary Post Hoc Outcome\nCorticosteroids were used during the ICU stay in 189 patients. There was no significant effect of cisatracurium use on the 90-day mortality in the subgroup of patients given corticosteroids (Figure 6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nVentilator Settings and Lung Function\nVentilator settings and lung-function variables during the first week are given in Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix. On day 7, the PaO2:FIO2 ratio was higher, and the PaCO2 value lower, in the cisatracurium group than in the placebo group.\nCointerventions\nDuring the ICU stay, there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of cointerventions. A total of 42% of patients in the cisatracurium group and 48% in the placebo group were treated with the use of prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, intravenous almitrine mesylate, or a combination of these (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The criteria for using these interventions were the same in the two groups.\nOpen-label cisatracurium was given more frequently in the placebo group than in the cisatracurium group during the first 48 hours after enrollment. However, the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the number of patients given at least one open-label cisatracurium bolus during the entire ICU stay after enrollment (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The required dose of sedatives or analgesics was similar in the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
