Diuresis or fluid restriction may improve lung function but could jeopardize extrapulmonary-organ perfusion.\nMethods\nIn a randomized study, we compared a conservative and a liberal strategy of fluid management using explicit protocols applied for seven days in 1000 patients with acute lung injury. The primary end point was death at 60 days. Secondary end points included the number of ventilator-free days and organ-failure–free days and measures of lung physiology.\nResults\nThe rate of death at 60 days was 25.5 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, −2.6 to 8.4 percent). The mean (±SE) cumulative fluid balance during the first seven days was –136±491 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 6992±502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). As compared with the liberal strategy, the conservative strategy improved the oxygenation index ([mean airway pressure×the ratio of the fraction of inspired oxygen to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen]×100) and the lung injury score and increased the number of ventilator-free days (14.6±0.5 vs. 12.1±0.5, P<0.001) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (13.4±0.4 vs. 11.2±0.4, P<0.001) during the first 28 days but did not increase the incidence or prevalence of shock during the study or the use of dialysis during the first 60 days (10 percent vs. 14 percent, P=0.06).\nConclusions\nAlthough there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy of fluid management improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00281268.)\nPulmonary edema resulting from increased capillary permeability, a hallmark of acute lung injury, worsens as intravascular hydrostatic pressure rises and oncotic pressure falls.1,2 Although lung failure alone can be lethal, death in patients with acute lung injury is usually due to the failure of nonpulmonary organs.1,3\nThe optimal fluid management of acute lung injury is not settled.4–7 The usual practice is wide-ranging, and many practitioners weigh the risks and benefits of strategies of conservative as compared with liberal fluid management. In the conservative approach, fluid intake is restricted and urinary output is increased in an attempt to decrease lung edema, shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, and improve survival. A possible risk of this approach is a decrease in cardiac output and worsening of nonpulmonary-organ function. The liberal fluid approach essentially reverses these potential priorities and risks.\nCurrent evidence is insufficient to support the use of either a liberal or conservative fluid strategy in patients with established acute lung injury.8–11 We conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial to investigate the risks and benefits of a fluid-management protocol with a lower (conservative use of fluids) or higher (liberal use of fluids) intravascular pressure (as defined by the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure or central venous pressure) in patients with acute lung injury. Our primary outcome was death from any cause at 60 days.\nMethods\nStudy Design\nThe complete protocol for this trial can be found in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). Patients were randomly assigned to a strategy involving either conservative or liberal use of fluids with concealed allocation in permuted blocks of eight with the use of an automated system. Participants were simultaneously randomly assigned to receive either a pulmonary-artery catheter or a central venous catheter in a two-by-two factorial design.12\nInclusion Criteria\nEligible patients were intubated and received positive-pressure ventilation, had a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 300 (adjusted if the altitude exceeded 1000 m), and had bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography consistent with the presence of pulmonary edema without evidence of left atrial hypertension.13 If a potential participant did not have a central venous catheter, the primary physician's intent to insert one was required.\nExclusion Criteria\nReasons for exclusion are listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Major reasons for exclusion were the presence of a pulmonary-artery catheter after the onset of acute lung injury; the presence of acute lung injury for more than 48 hours; inability to obtain consent; the presence of chronic conditions that could independently influence survival, impair weaning, or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., severe lung or neuromuscular disease or dependence on dialysis); and irreversible conditions for which the estimated six-month mortality rate exceeded 50 percent, such as advanced cancer.\nStudy Procedures\nVentilation according to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network protocol of lower tidal volumes was begun within one hour after randomization and continued until day 28; a protocol was used to wean patients from mechanical ventilation.14 The assigned catheter was inserted within four hours after randomization. Hemodynamic management was started within 2 hours after catheter insertion and continued for seven days or until 12 hours after a patient was able to breathe without assistance.14 After day 3, a pulmonary-artery catheter could be replaced by a central venous catheter if hemodynamic stability (i.e., absence of the need\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>EVENT<|>Acute lung injury is a condition characterized by pulmonary edema resulting from increased capillary permeability, often leading to lung failure and affecting nonpulmonary organs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONSERVATIVE STRATEGY<|>EVENT<|>A fluid management strategy that restricts fluid intake and increases urinary output to decrease lung edema and improve lung function in patients with acute lung injury)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBERAL STRATEGY<|>EVENT<|>A fluid management strategy that allows higher fluid intake, potentially increasing intravascular pressure, used in patients with acute lung injury)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLINICAL TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>A prospective, randomized study comparing conservative and liberal fluid management strategies in 1000 patients with acute lung injury)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>CONSERVATIVE STRATEGY<|>The conservative strategy is used to manage fluid in patients with acute lung injury to improve lung function<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>LIBERAL STRATEGY<|>The liberal strategy is an alternative fluid management approach for patients with acute lung injury<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICAL TRIAL<|>CONSERVATIVE STRATEGY<|>The clinical trial tested the effectiveness of the conservative strategy in managing acute lung injury<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLINICAL TRIAL<|>LIBERAL STRATEGY<|>The clinical trial compared the liberal strategy with the conservative strategy in managing acute lung injury<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
