Data collectors were aware of the study-group assignments, but outcomes assessors were not.\nThe trial was overseen by a steering committee that met monthly. An independent data and safety monitoring board, comprising three experts in the field, was also set up (a list of board members is provided in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no commercial support. No one who is not listed as an author contributed to the writing of this manuscript. All authors vouch for the accuracy of the data and analysis and the fidelity of the study to the protocol.\nProtocol\nAfter a patient was determined to be eligible, a stabilization period of 12 to 24 hours was mandated. Inclusion in the study was confirmed only at the end of this period (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nPatients assigned to the prone group had to be turned to the prone position within the first hour after randomization. They were placed in a completely prone position for at least 16 consecutive hours. Participating centers were given guidelines (see the Supplementary Appendix) to ensure standardization of prone placement. Standard ICU beds were used for all patients. Patients assigned to the supine group remained in a semirecumbent position.\nMechanical ventilation13 was delivered in a volume-controlled mode with constant inspiratory flow, with tidal volume targeted at 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight13 and the PEEP level selected from a PEEP–FiO2 table14 (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The goal was to maintain an end-inspiratory plateau pressure of the respiratory system (PplatRS), measured after a 1-second period of no air flow, of no more than 30 cm of water and an arterial plasma pH of 7.20 to 7.45. Physiological variables were measured at predetermined times in both groups. In the supine group, measurements were performed every 6 hours; in the prone group, measurements were performed just before the patient was turned to the prone position, after 1 hour of prone positioning, just before the patient was turned back to the supine position, and 4 hours after the patient was returned to the supine position. Adjustments of ventilator settings in specific situations are detailed in the Supplementary Appendix.\nThe criteria for stopping prone treatment were any of the following: improvement in oxygenation (defined as a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of ≥150 mm Hg, with a PEEP of ≤10 cm of water and an FiO2 of ≤0.6; in the prone group, these criteria had to be met in the supine position at least 4 hours after the end of the last prone session); a decrease in the PaO2:FiO2 ratio of more than 20%, relative to the ratio in the supine position, before two consecutive prone sessions; or complications occurring during a prone session and leading to its immediate interruption. Complications leading to the immediate interruption of prone treatment included nonscheduled extubation, main-stem bronchus intubation, endotracheal-tube obstruction, hemoptysis, oxygen saturation of less than 85% on pulse oximetry or a PaO2 of less than 55 mm Hg for more than 5 minutes when the FiO2 was 1.0, cardiac arrest, a heart rate of less than 30 beats per minute for more than 1 minute, a systolic blood pressure of less than 60 mm Hg for more than 5 minutes, and any other life-threatening reason for which the clinician decided to stop the treatment.\nAfter patients in the prone group were turned to the supine position, the prone session could be resumed at any time before the planned assessment at 4 hours in the supine position if the criteria for oxygen saturation level, PaO2, or both were met. The prone-positioning strategy was applied every day up to day 28, after which it was used at the clinician's discretion. Patients in the supine group could not be crossed over to the prone group except as a rescue measure in case of life-threatening hypoxemia when all the following criteria were met simultaneously: a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of less than 55 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of 1.0; maximal PEEP according to the PEEP–FiO2 table; administration of inhaled nitric oxide at a concentration of 10 ppm; infusion of intravenous almitrine bismesylate at a dose of 4 μg per kilogram per minute; and performance of respiratory recruitment maneuvers to increase the amount of aerated lung.\nWeaning from mechanical ventilation was conducted in the same way for both groups (see the Supplementary Appendix). Details regarding the management of sedation and the use of neuromuscular blocking agents are also provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The investigators assessed patients at least every morning until day 28 or discharge from the ICU.\nData Collection\nAt the time of admission, we recorded data on age, sex, the setting from which the patient was admitted to the ICU, the context for admission to the ICU, McCabe score14 (which ranges from A to C, with A indicating no underlying disease that compromises life expectancy, B an estimated life expectancy with the chronic disease of <5 years, and C an estimated life expectancy with the chronic disease of <1 year), ventilator settings, time from intubation to randomization, height, predicted body weight, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II15 (which ranges from 0 to 164, with higher scores indicating greater severity of symptoms). We also recorded the number of lung quadrants involved on chest radiography, results of measurements of arterial blood gases, PplatRS, arterial blood lactate levels, the cause of ARDS, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
