Physiologic and radiographic data, medication use, and use of other investigational treatments were recorded between 6 and 10 a.m. on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Data were transmitted weekly to the network coordinating center. Patients were followed until day 180 or until they were breathing on their own at home.\nAssessment of Compliance\nRandomly selected ventilator and blood gas variables were analyzed for compatibility with the protocol. Quarterly reports of these data from each of the 10 centers were used by investigators to assess compliance.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. Patients who were in other types of health care facilities at 180 days were considered to have been discharged from the hospital and to be breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was ventilator-free days, defined as the number of days from day 1 to day 28 on which a patient breathed without assistance, if the period of unassisted breathing lasted at least 48 consecutive hours. A difference in ventilator-free days could reflect a difference in mortality, ventilator days among survivors, or both. Other outcomes were the number of days without organ or system failure and the occurrence of barotrauma, defined as any new pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or subcutaneous emphysema, or a pneumatocele that was more than 2 cm in diameter. Interim analyses were conducted by an independent data and safety monitoring board after the enrollment of each successive group of approximately 200 patients. Stopping boundaries (with a two-sided α level of 0.05) were designed to allow early termination of the study if the use of lower tidal volumes was found to be either efficacious31 or ineffective.32\nThe comparison of traditional with lower tidal volumes was one of two trials conducted simultaneously in the same patients in a factorial experimental design. Ketoconazole was compared with placebo in the first 234 patients, and lisofylline was compared with placebo in the last 194 patients; no drugs were assessed in the middle 433 patients.\nWe used Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test to compare base-line variables. We used analysis of covariance to compare log-transformed plasma interleukin-6 values. We used Wilcoxon's test to compare the day 0 and day 3 plasma interleukin-6 concentrations, ventilator-free days, and organ-failure–free days, which had skewed distributions. We used the 180-day cumulative incidence of mortality to compare the proportion of patients in each group who died before being discharged home and breathing without assistance,33 after stratification for other experimental interventions: treatment with ketoconazole, the ketoconazole placebo, lisofylline, the lisofylline placebo, or no other agent. We used a chi-square test to determine whether there was an interaction between the study group and the other experimental interventions with respect to the mean (±SE) mortality rates at 180 days. All P values are two-sided.\nResults\nThe trial was stopped after the fourth interim analysis because the use of lower tidal volumes was found to be efficacious (P=0.005 for the difference in mortality between groups; P value for the stopping boundary, 0.023). The base-line characteristics of the 861 patients who were enrolled were similar, except that minute ventilation was slightly but significantly higher (P=0.01) in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (Table 2).\nTable 2\n\nBase-Line Characteristics of the Patients.\nThe tidal volumes and plateau pressures were significantly lower on days 1, 3, and 7 in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (Table 3). The mean (±SD) tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2± 0.8 and 11.8±0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25±6 and 33±8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively. The partial pressure of arterial oxygen was similar in the two groups at all three times, but the positive end-expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen were significantly higher and the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen was significantly lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days 1 and 3. On day 7, positive end-expiratory pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen were significantly higher in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. The respiratory rate was significantly higher in the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days 1 and 3, but minute ventilation was similar in the two groups on these days. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide was significantly higher on days 1, 3, and 7 and arterial pH was significantly lower on days 1 and 3 in the group treated with lower tidal volumes.\nTable 3\n\nRespiratory Values during the First Seven Days of Treatment in Patients with Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\nThe probability of survival and of being discharged home and breathing without assistance during the first 180 days after randomization is shown in Figure 1. The mortality rate was 39.8 percent in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and 31.0 percent in the group\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>R & D SYSTEMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R & D Systems is a company based in Minneapolis that provides immunoassay kits for measuring plasma interleukin-6)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINNEAPOLIS<|>GEO<|>Minneapolis is a city in the United States where R & D Systems is located)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An independent board responsible for conducting interim analyses and ensuring the safety and integrity of the trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KETOCONAZOLE<|>EVENT<|>A trial comparing ketoconazole with placebo was conducted as part of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LISOFYLLINE<|>EVENT<|>A trial comparing lisofylline with placebo was conducted as part of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>EVENT<|>A medical condition that was part of the study focus, involving patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME<|>EVENT<|>A severe lung condition that was part of the study focus, involving patients with acute lung injury)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R & D SYSTEMS<|>MINNEAPOLIS<|>R & D Systems is located in Minneapolis<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD<|>KETOCONAZOLE<|>The Data and Safety Monitoring Board conducted interim analyses for the ketoconazole trial<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD<|>LISOFYLLINE<|>The Data and Safety Monitoring Board conducted interim analyses for the lisofylline trial<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME<|>Acute lung injury is a condition that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
