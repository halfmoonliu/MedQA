The conservative-strategy group had more ventilator-free days, days free of central nervous system failure, and ICU-free days during the first 28 days. There were no significant differences in the number of failure-free days for other organs during the first 28 days, although there was a small (0.3 day) increase in the number of cardiovascular-failure–free days during the first 7 days with the liberal strategy. Within the first 60 days, there were no significant differences in either the percentage of patients receiving renal-replacement therapy (10 percent in the conservative-strategy group vs. 14 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.06) or the average number of days of renal support (11.0±1.7 vs. 10.9±1.4, P=0.96). There were no significant interactions between baseline shock status and treatment with respect to the mortality rate or the number of ventilator-free days or ICU-free days (Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 3\n\nProbability of Survival to Hospital Discharge and of Breathing without Assistance during the First 60 Days after Randomization.\nTable 3\n\nMain Outcome Variables.\nBlack patients had a higher overall rate of death (37.3 percent of 118 black patients in the liberal-strategy group and 31.3 percent of 99 black patients in the conservative-strategy group) than white patients (22.7 percent of 313 white patients in the liberal-strategy group and 23.5 percent of 328 white patients in the conservative-strategy group) (P=0.002). Hispanic patients also had a higher mortality rate (38.5 percent of 52 Hispanic patients in the liberal-strategy group and 23.0 percent of 61 Hispanic patients in the conservative-strategy group) than whites, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.10). After adjustment for baseline covariates, the hazard ratio for death among blacks as compared with whites was not significant (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.73), whereas it was significant for Hispanics (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.31). The interaction between treatment and race for whites as compared with nonwhites was not significant (P=0.10), nor was it significant in any of the racial or ethnic subgroups. There was also no significant interaction between treatment and sex.\nDiscussion\nAlthough we did not detect a significant difference between the conservative strategy and the liberal strategy of fluid management in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. The overall difference in mortality according to race or ethnic group has previously been described in patients with acute lung injury22 and could be due to several factors, including socioeconomic disparities or genetic determinants.23\nThe two strategies were designed to be prudent but distinctly different approaches to fluid therapy. To place the results of our study in context, it is useful to consider how these fluid strategies compare with usual practice. In this regard, it is of interest that the cumulative seven-day fluid balance in the liberal-strategy group (6992±502 ml) was similar to that among patients in ARDS Network studies in which the approach to fluid management was not specified14,24 (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). These findings are similar to those reported by Simmons et al.8 in 1987, suggesting that the liberal approach to fluid management reflects long-standing practices. The usual practice resembles the liberal approach in another aspect: the prestudy baseline measurements for central venous pressure (12.2 mm Hg) and pulmonary-artery–occlusion pressure (15.7 mm Hg) were both within the target ranges for the liberal fluid strategy (10 to 14 mm Hg and 14 to 18 mm Hg, respectively).\nComparisons of our study to other studies of goal-directed management in critically ill patients are problematic because of differences in protocols, patient populations, and timing of the interventions. Whereas we targeted central venous pressure or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure in patients with recent onset of acute lung injury, previous studies targeted the cardiac index, oxygen delivery, or mixed venous oxygen saturation in heterogeneous populations of critically ill patients.25–31 Rivers et al.32 demonstrated in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock the efficacy of six hours of early, goal-directed resuscitation in the emergency department before admission to the ICU. In contrast, our patients received their first protocol intervention an average of 43 hours after admission to the ICU and 24 hours after meeting the criteria for acute lung injury.\nThe conservative-strategy group had higher serum oncotic pressures and lower intravascular pressures — characteristics that would be expected to limit the development of pulmonary edema. With lung injury, small increases in the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure are associated with large increases in extravascular lung water.2 The higher albumin and hemoglobin levels in the conservative-strategy group appear to be primarily related to hemoconcentration (or less hemodilution), since the rate of albumin use was low and not significantly different between groups and red-cell transfusions were more frequent in the liberal-strategy group.\nOur results are consistent with those obtained in studies in animals suggesting improved lung function with diuretics and fluid restriction33–37 and with the results of observational studies\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CONSERVATIVE-STRATEGY GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group in the study that followed a conservative fluid management strategy, resulting in more ventilator-free days and improved lung function)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBERAL-STRATEGY GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group in the study that followed a liberal fluid management strategy, with a higher cumulative fluid balance and similar mortality rates to the conservative-strategy group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACK PATIENTS<|>PERSON<|>A racial group in the study with a higher overall rate of death compared to white patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WHITE PATIENTS<|>PERSON<|>A racial group in the study with a lower overall rate of death compared to black and Hispanic patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISPANIC PATIENTS<|>PERSON<|>A racial group in the study with a higher mortality rate compared to white patients, but not statistically significant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARDS NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A research network involved in studies related to acute respiratory distress syndrome and fluid management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIMMONS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who reported findings in 1987 suggesting that the liberal approach to fluid management reflects long-standing practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RIVERS ET AL.<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who demonstrated the efficacy of early, goal-directed resuscitation in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONSERVATIVE-STRATEGY GROUP<|>LIBERAL-STRATEGY GROUP<|>The conservative-strategy group had more ventilator-free days and improved lung function compared to the liberal-strategy group<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACK PATIENTS<|>WHITE PATIENTS<|>Black patients had a higher overall rate of death compared to white patients<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISPANIC PATIENTS<|>WHITE PATIENTS<|>Hispanic patients had a higher mortality rate compared to white patients, but this difference was not statistically significant<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARDS NETWORK<|>LIBERAL-STRATEGY GROUP<|>The cumulative fluid balance in the liberal-strategy group was similar to that in ARDS Network studies<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SIMMONS ET AL.<|>LIBERAL-STRATEGY GROUP<|>Simmons et al. reported findings in 1987 that align with the liberal approach to fluid management<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RIVERS ET AL.<|>CONSERVATIVE-STRATEGY GROUP<|>Rivers et al. demonstrated early resuscitation efficacy, contrasting with the conservative-strategy group's later intervention<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
