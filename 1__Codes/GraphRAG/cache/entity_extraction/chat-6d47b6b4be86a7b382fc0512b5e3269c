This period may have contributed to the selection of patients with more severe ARDS19 who could benefit from the advantages of the prone positioning, such as relief of severe hypoxemia and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. A previous study has shown that prone positioning, as compared with supine positioning, markedly reduces the overinflated lung areas while promoting alveolar recruitment.5 These effects (reduction in overdistention and recruitment enhancement) may help prevent ventilator-induced lung injury by homogenizing the distribution of stress and strain within the lungs. In our trial, alveolar recruitment was not directly assessed. However, studies have shown that lung recruitability correlates with the extent of hypoxemia20,21 and that the transpulmonary pressure along the ventral-to-dorsal axis is more homogeneously distributed in the prone position than in the supine position.22 We therefore suggest that prone positioning in our patients induced a decrease in lung stress and strain.\nThird, as in previous investigations,9,10 we used long prone-positioning sessions. Fourth, the prone position was applied for 73% of the time ascribed to the intervention and was concentrated over a period of a few days. Fifth, in our trial, the tidal volume was lower than in previous trials,9,10 and the PplatRS was kept below 30 cm of water. However, because all patients were returned to the supine position at least once a day, the effect of the prone position itself cannot be distinguished from the effects of being moved from the supine to the prone position over the course of a day.\nWe should acknowledge that the technical aspects of prone positioning are not simple and that a coordinated team effort is required (see Videos 1 and 2, available at NEJM.org). All centers participating in this study were skilled in the process of turning patients from the supine to the prone position, as shown by the absence of adverse events directly related to repositioning. Because the experience of the units may explain the low rate of complications, our results cannot necessarily be generalized to centers without such experience. We should also emphasize that our results were obtained in the subgroup of severely ill patients with ARDS.\nIt could be argued that our results can be explained by higher mortality in the control group. However, mortality at day 28 in the supine group was similar to that among controls in recent trials.23,24 Furthermore, although the mortality in the control group was lower than that used to compute the power of this study, we calculated that the power of our study was 99%.\nThe study has several limitations. Although we planned to record the data of patients who were eligible but not included, only a few ICUs complied with this request, making it impossible to fully appreciate the physiological condition of the excluded patients. In addition, fluid balance and the cumulative dose of catecholamines were not assessed. The imbalance between the groups in baseline SOFA score, vasopressor use, and the use of neuromuscular blockers could also have influenced the results. However, even after adjustment for these covariates, mortality was significantly lower in the prone group.\nIn conclusion, this trial showed that patients with ARDS and severe hypoxemia (as confirmed by a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of <150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of ≥0.6 and a PEEP of ≥5 cm of water) can benefit from prone treatment when it is used early and in relatively long sessions.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
