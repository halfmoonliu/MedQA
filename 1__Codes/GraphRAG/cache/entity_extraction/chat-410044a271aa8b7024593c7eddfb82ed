The results were consistent in a multivariable analysis (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), in an analysis of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), and in an analysis of 28-day mortality. Subgroup analyses showed no interaction of mortality with baseline severity of hypoxemia, respiratory compliance, body-mass index, or use or nonuse of vasopressors or with center experience in the trial (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 2\n\nProbability of Survival from the Day of Randomization to Day 60 in the HFOV and Control Groups.\nTable 4\n\nOutcomes.\nEarly Physiological Responses to Ventilation\nTable S3 in the Supplementary Appendix shows early physiological responses to HFOV and to control ventilation. The use of vasopressors was similar in the HFOV and control groups before the initiation of ventilation (66% and 61%, respectively; P=0.24) but increased in the HFOV group as compared with the control group within 4 hours after initiation (73% vs. 62%, P=0.01) and increased even more in the HFOV group by the following day (78% vs. 58%, P<0.001). The use of neuromuscular blockers followed a similar pattern: 27% of patients in the HFOV group and 29% of those in the control group received neuromuscular blockers before the initiation of ventilation (P=0.66), 46% as compared with 31% received them within 4 hours after initiation (P<0.001), and 46% as compared with 26% received them the next day (P<0.001). The mean FiO2 at these time points decreased to a similar extent in both groups: the FiO2 was 0.75 in the HFOV group and 0.73 in the control group before initiation (P=0.93); 0.62 and 0.64 in the two groups, respectively, 4 hours after initiation (P=0.94); and 0.51 and 0.50, respectively, the next day (P=0.97).\nCardiorespiratory Results\nTable S4 in the Supplementary Appendix shows cardiorespiratory data from the first week of the study. On day 1, the mean (±SD) of the mean airway pressure in the HFOV group was 31±2.6 cm of water, with a frequency of 5.5±1.0 Hz; patients in the control group underwent ventilation with a tidal volume of 6.1±1.3 ml per kilogram, PEEP of 18±3.2, and plateau pressure of 32±5.7 cm of water. The mean FiO2 in the control group was similar to or lower than that in the HFOV group, despite lower mean airway pressures. The net fluid balance was higher in the HFOV group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant. In the HFOV group, 270 of the 275 patients (98%) underwent HFOV for a median of 3 days (interquartile range, 2 to 8); a total of 222 patients (81%) survived and were transitioned to conventional ventilation for a further 5 days (interquartile range, 2 to 7). In the control group, 34 patients (12%) crossed over to HFOV (31 according to protocol and 3 in violation of protocol) for 7 days (interquartile range, 5 to 15), beginning 2 days (interquartile range, 1 to 4) after randomization; 24 of those 34 patients (71%) died in the hospital.\nCointerventions\nDuring the course of the study, larger proportions of patients in the HFOV group than in the control group received vasoactive drugs (91% vs. 84%, P=0.01) and neuromuscular blockers (83% vs. 68%, P<0.001); vasoactive drugs were administered for an average of 2 days longer in the HFOV group than in the control group, and neuromuscular blockers were administered for an average of 1 day longer in the HFOV group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Sedatives and opioids (most commonly midazolam and fentanyl) were administered for the same duration in the two groups (median, 10 days [interquartile range, 6 to 18] and 10 days [interquartile range, 6 to 17], respectively; P=0.99), but during the first week the median doses of midazolam were significantly higher in the HFOV group than in the control group (199 mg per day [interquartile range, 100 to 382] vs. 141 mg per day [interquartile range, 68 to 240], P<0.001), and there was a trend toward higher doses of fentanyl equivalents in the HFOV group (2980 μg per day [interquartile range, 1258 to 4800] vs. 2400 μg per day [interquartile range, 1140 to 4430], P=0.06) (for daily doses of selected sedative and analgesic drugs, see Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).The rates of use of other cointerventions, including glucocorticoids, renal-replacement therapy, and prone positioning\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
