We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model.\nResults\nThe hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7% (95% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3% (95% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P=0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups.\nConclusions\nIn patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness. (Funded by Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Marseille and the Programme Hospitalier de Recherche Clinique Régional 2004-26 of the French Ministry of Health; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00299650.)\nThe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure; it affects both medical and surgical patients.1 Despite rigorous physiological management,2 in most studies, ARDS has been fatal in 40 to 60% of patients.3–7\nNeuromuscular blocking agents are used in a large but highly variable proportion of patients with ARDS.8–12 Current guidelines indicate that neuromuscular blocking agents are appropriate for facilitating mechanical ventilation when sedation alone is inadequate, most notably in patients with severe gas-exchange impairments.10 In a four-center randomized, controlled trial of gas exchange in 56 patients with ARDS,13 infusion of a neuromuscular blocking agent for a period of 48 hours was associated with improved oxygenation and a trend toward lower mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) (46%, vs. 71% among patients who did not receive a blocking agent; P=0.06). However, this study was not designed or powered to evaluate mortality. Thus, the benefits and risks of adjunctive therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with ARDS who were receiving lung-protective mechanical ventilation14 require further evaluation.\nWe conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine whether a short period of treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium besylate early in the course of severe ARDS would improve clinical outcomes.\nMethods\nPatients\nPatients were enrolled from March 2006 through March 2008 at 20 ICUs in France (see the Appendix). Eligibility criteria were the receipt of endotracheal mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and the presence of all of the following conditions for a period of no longer than 48 hours: ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2, measured in millimeters of mercury) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2, which is unitless) of less than 150 with the ventilator set to deliver a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm of water or higher and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with edema. An additional eligibility criterion was the absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension — that is, a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure, if available, of less than 18 mm Hg. If the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was not available, echocardiography was performed if the patient had a history of, or risk factors for, ischemic heart disease or had crackles on auscultation. Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n\nRandomization and Follow-up of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nThe trial was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Randomization and blinding regarding the study-group assignments were performed according to Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, as indicated in the Supplementary Appendix\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
