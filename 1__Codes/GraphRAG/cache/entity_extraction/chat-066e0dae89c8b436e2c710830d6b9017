To facilitate comparison, we report all neuromuscular blockade use as the equivalent cisatracurium dose.27\nEnd Points\nThe primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days (in-hospital was defined as the time in the trial hospital plus transfer to another hospital, including the time in long-term acute care facilities). Secondary end points were organ dysfunction (as assessed on the basis of the Sequential Organ Failure [SOFA] score28; scores range from 0 to 4 for each of six organ systems, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction), in-hospital death at day 28, days free of organ dysfunction, days not in the ICU, days free of mechanical ventilation, and days not in the hospital at day 28. End points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months were survival, disability, health-related quality of life, patient-reported health, pain interference, symptoms resembling those of post-traumatic stress, cognitive function, and return to work.29-33 Safety end points included recall of paralysis (assessed with the modified Brice questionnaire), ICU-acquired weakness up to day 28 (assessed with the Medical Research Council scale, which includes scores for muscle strength in 6 muscle groups on each side of the body, for a total of 12 muscle groups; the score for each muscle group can range from 0 [no movement observed] to 5 [the muscle contracts normally against full resistance], with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60), limitations on physical activity (assessed with the ICU Mobility Scale; scores range from 0 [no movement] to 10 [walking without aid]), new-onset atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia, barotrauma, and investigator-reported adverse events.34-38 We could not ensure that the in-hospital assessors of end points were unaware of treatment group, but all postdischarge end points were assessed by trial personnel who were unaware of the group assignment.\nStatistical Analysis\nUnder the assumption that 27% of patients in the intervention group and 35% in the control group would die, we calculated that 1408 patients would need to be enrolled to provide the trial with 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups in treatment effect, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.5,25,39 The trial was designed to be stopped if superiority of either group was established using symmetric group sequential flexible stopping boundaries, with no stopping rule for futility.40 We compared the primary end point between groups with the use of a Wald test for the difference of two proportions. We performed prespecified analyses according to severity of ARDS (Pao2:Fio2 <120 mm Hg or ≥120 mm Hg) and duration of ARDS (a duration less than or greater than the median time from meeting inclusion criteria to randomization) as well as for the potential effect of excluding patients who had previously received neuromuscular blockade (hospitals were divided into terciles on the basis of their exclusion rate of patients who had previously received neuromuscular blockade). We also tested for interactions between treatment group and sex, race, and ethnic group. All treatment-by-subgroup interactions were analyzed on the risk difference scale with the use of a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution function and an identity link function. Secondary end points are reported with observed differences and 95% confidence intervals. Adverse events were compared between groups, with the event the unit of analysis and with the use of weighted Poisson regression; nonserious events were weighted by 1 and serious events were weighted by 2. Mortality at 90 days and at 1 year was compared between the groups with the use of a z-test, which was based on the point estimates and standard errors of the within-group nonparametric interval-censored survival functions. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).\nResults\nPatients\nFrom January 2016 through April 2018, we screened 4848 patients at 48 hospitals across the United States, and 1006 patients were included in the primary analysis (Figure 1). After the second interim analysis, the decision to stop the trial for futility was made independently by the data and safety monitoring board; the decision was endorsed by the NHLBI and accepted by the PETAL steering committee. The most common reason for exclusion was improvement in the Pao2:Fio2 before enrollment (658 patients). The most common reason for exclusion after screening was the previous receipt of neuromuscular blockade (655 patients). Of the patients who were enrolled, 501 were randomly assigned to the intervention group, and 505 to the control group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients were enrolled a median of 7.6 hours (interquartile range, 3.7 to 15.6) after diagnosis of moderate-to-severe ARDS; 9.3% of the patients (94 patients) were enrolled with a qualifying Spo2:Fio2 (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nPatient Screening, Enrollment, and Follow-up.\nTable 1\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nNeuromuscular Blockade, Sedation, and Other Care Processes\nIn the intervention group, 488 patients (97.4%) received a cisatracurium infusion, beginning a mean (±SD)\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
