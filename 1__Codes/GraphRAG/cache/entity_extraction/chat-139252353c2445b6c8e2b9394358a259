The median duration of cisatracurium administration over the 48-hour intervention period was 47.8 hours (interquartile range, 43.8 to 48.0), and the median cumulative dose was 1807 mg (interquartile range, 1706 to 1815). Overall, the cisatracurium infusion was stopped early in 74 patients (14.8%) because of clinical improvement. In the control group, 86 patients (17.0%) received a neuromuscular blocking agent during the first 48 hours at a median cisatracurium (or equivalent) dose of 38 mg (interquartile range, 14 to 200). Additional details on the dosing of neuromuscular blocking agents are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Patients in the intervention group were under deeper sedation than patients in the control group both during the 48-hour intervention period and on the third trial day (Figure 2). During the first 24 hours, patients in the intervention group had lower PEEP requirements than patients in the control group (between-group difference, −0.9 cm of water; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.5 to −0.4). During the first and second 24-hour periods, patients in the intervention group also had lower minute ventilation (the between-group difference on day 1 was −0.7 liters per minute [95% CI, −1.1 to −0.2], and on day 2, −0.8 liters per minute [95% CI, −1.2 to −0.4]), lower Fio2 requirements (the between-group difference on both day 1 and day 2 was −0.04 [95% CI, −0.06 to −0.02]), and higher driving pressures (the between-group difference on day 1 was 0.7 cm of water [95% CI, 0.0 to 1.3], and on day 2, 0.8 cm of water [95% CI, 0.1 to −1.5]). However, there were no between-group differences in the Pao2:Fio2 from day 1 through day 7. Improvement in oxygenation was similar among patients who were enrolled early and those who were enrolled late after the onset of ARDS. From day 1 through day 7, there was good adherence to the protocol with respect to PEEP and Fio2 recommendations, and adherence to recommended ventilation guidelines ranged from 80.1 to 87.5% with respect to low tidal volume ventilation (≤6.5 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight) and 85.6 to 90.8% with respect to low plateau pressures (≤30 cm of water). The median daily fluid balance was 327 ml (interquartile range, −951 to 1456) on day 2 and −242 ml (interquartile range, −1432 to 728) on day 3, and there were no differences between trial groups. Additional details are provided in Figure S1 and Tables S4 through S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.\nFigure 2\n\nNeuromuscular Blockade and Sedation.\nPrimary End Point\nAt 90 days, in-hospital death from any cause occurred in 213 patients (42.5%) in the intervention group and in 216 patients (42.8%) in the control group (between-group difference, −0.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −6.4 to 5.9; P=0.93) (Figure 3 and Table 2). Treatment-by-subgroup interactions were not significant with respect to ARDS severity, ARDS duration, or previous neuromuscular blockade use stratified according to hospital tercile. Other than the interaction of treatment assignment with ethnic group (P=0.02 for interaction), no other interactions were significant (Fig. S2 and Tables S9 through S15 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 3\n\nPatients Who Survived to Hospital Discharge and Were Discharged Home during the First 90 Days after Randomization.\nTable 2\n\nEnd Points.\nSecondary End Points\nAt 28 days, there was no between-group difference in hospital mortality, days free of ventilation, days out of the ICU, or days out of the hospital (Table 2). Cardiovascular SOFA scores were higher in the intervention group than in the control group on day 1 (between-group difference, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4) and day 2 (between-group difference, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.5). However, there were no differences thereafter, nor were there differences in total SOFA scores or other organ-specific SOFA scores. The use of adjunctive therapies appeared to be similar in the two groups during the 48-hour intervention period (between-group difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.0 to 5.5) and through day 28 (between-group difference, 1.2 percentage points; 95% CI\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
