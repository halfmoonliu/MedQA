Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.\nFigure 1\n\nRandomization and Follow-up of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nThe trial was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Randomization and blinding regarding the study-group assignments were performed according to Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, as indicated in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The study protocol and statistical analysis plan (also available at NEJM.org) were approved for all centers by the ethics committee of the Marseille University Hospital (Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale), according to French law. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and statistical analysis plan. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their proxies.\nStudy Treatment\nCisatracurium besylate (150-mg formulation, GlaxoSmithKline) and placebo were prepared in identical separate 30-ml vials for intravenous infusion. Peripheral-nerve stimulators were not permitted. The Ramsay sedation scale was used to adapt sedative requirements. The scale assigns the conscious state a score of 1 (anxious, agitated, or restless) to 6 (no response on glabellar tap). Once the assigned Ramsay sedation score was 6 and the ventilator settings were adjusted (Table 1), a 3-ml rapid intravenous infusion of 15 mg of cisatracurium besylate or placebo was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour for 48 hours. This regimen was based on the results of two studies of a total of 92 patients monitored for paralysis.13,15\nTable 1\n\nSummary of the Ventilation Procedure.\nVentilation and Weaning Protocol\nThe volume assist–control mode of ventilation was used, with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (Table 1). The goal was a saturation of peripheral blood oxygen (SpO2) as measured by means of pulse oximetry of 88 to 95% or a PaO2 of 55 to 80 mm Hg. To achieve this goal, FIO2 and the positive end-expiratory pressure were adjusted as in the Prospective, Randomized, Multi-Center Trial of 12 ml/kg Tidal Volume Positive Pressure Ventilation for Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARMA).14\nAn open-label, rapid, intravenous injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium was allowed in both groups if the end-inspiratory plateau pressure remained greater than 32 cm of water for at least 10 minutes despite the administration of increasing doses of sedatives and decreasing tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (if tolerated). If this rapid, intravenous injection resulted in a decrease of the end-inspiratory plateau pressure by less than 2 cm of water, a second injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium was allowed. If after the injection, the end-inspiratory plateau pressure did not decrease or decreased by less than 2 cm of water, cisatracurium was not administered again during the following 24-hour period.\nOrgan or System Failure\nPatients were monitored daily for 28 days for signs of failure of nonpulmonary organs or systems.14 Circulatory failure was defined as systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or the need for vasopressor therapy. Coagulation failure was defined as a platelet count of 80,000 or less per cubic millimeter. Hepatic failure was defined as a serum bilirubin level of 2 mg per deciliter (34 μmol per liter) or higher. Renal failure was defined as a serum creatinine level of 2 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter) or higher. The number of days without organ or system failure was calculated by subtracting the number of days with organ failure from 28 days or from the number of days until death, if death occurred before day 28. Organs and systems were considered to be free of failure after hospital discharge. There was no recommendation regarding volume-resuscitation goals.\nData Collection\nDuring the 24-hour period before randomization, we recorded data on demographic characteristics, physiological variables, relevant interventions performed in the ICU, radiographic findings, coexisting conditions, and medications. Data on ventilator settings, physiological variables, radiographic findings, and relevant therapeutic interventions were also recorded just before starting the study-drug infusion and again at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Physiological variables were also measured daily between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. until day 90 or until hospital discharge of a patient who could breath spontaneously.\nOpioid doses were converted to morphine equivalents. The equivalencies were as follows: 0.01 mg of sufentanil=10 mg of morphine=0.1 mg of fentanyl=0.1 mg of remifentanil.16\nBarotrauma was defined as newly developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumatocele larger than 2 cm in diameter. Muscle strength was evaluated with the use of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, a previously validated scale that assesses three muscle groups in each arm and leg. The score for each muscle group can range from 0 (paralysis) to 5 (normal strength), with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60.17 The definition of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
