Muscle strength was evaluated with the use of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, a previously validated scale that assesses three muscle groups in each arm and leg. The score for each muscle group can range from 0 (paralysis) to 5 (normal strength), with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60.17 The definition of ICU-acquired paresis was an MRC score of less than 48.17\nStudy Outcomes\nPrimary Outcome\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died before hospital discharge and within 90 days after study enrollment (the 90-day mortality). Patients who were outside the hospital (including those in other types of health care facilities) and who were able to breathe spontaneously at day 90 were considered to have been discharged home. Because we anticipated that there would be an imbalance in at least one key risk factor at baseline, the primary outcome was derived from a Cox regression model in which we adjusted for such imbalance. We also report the crude mortality at day 90.\nSecondary Outcomes\nSecondary outcomes were the day-28 mortality, the numbers of days outside the ICU between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90, the number of days without organ or system failure between day 1 and day 28, the rate of barotrauma, the rate of ICU-acquired paresis, the MRC scores on day 28 and at the time of ICU discharge, and the numbers of ventilator-free days (days since successful weaning from mechanical ventilation) between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90. It was required that the patient breathe spontaneously, without the aid of a ventilator, for a period of at least 48 hours for weaning from the ventilator to be considered successful. The number of ventilator-free days was considered to be zero for patients who were weaned from mechanical ventilation but who died before day 28 or day 90.18\nStatistical Analysis\nAssumptions for the sample-size calculation were based on our previous studies13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria and on the European epidemiologic study Acute Lung Injury Verification (ALIVE).4 Assuming a 50% mortality at 90 days in the placebo group, we calculated that 340 patients would need to be enrolled to detect a 15% absolute reduction in the 90-day mortality in the cisatracurium group as compared with the placebo group, with 80% statistical power and a two-sided alpha value of 0.05. No interim analysis was performed.\nWe assessed the differences between the groups using Student's t-test, the Wilcoxon test, the chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. All reported P values are two-sided and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. Kaplan–Meier curves were plotted to assess the time from enrollment to death and the time to disconnection from the ventilator for a period of at least 48 hours.\nThe primary analysis consisted of evaluating the effect of cisatracurium on the primary outcome (i.e., 90-day mortality), with adjustment by means of a Cox multivariate proportional-hazards model that included two predefined covariates: the baseline Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and the baseline plateau pressure.19 SAPS II is calculated from 12 physiological measurements during a 24-hour period, information about previous health status, and some information obtained at admission. This score ranges from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. We planned to include all the variables for which there was an imbalance between the two groups at baseline, but the only imbalanced variable was the PaO2:FIO2 ratio. Therefore, we also conducted an analysis based on the baseline PaO2:FIO2 ratio, in which the two thirds of patients with a ratio below 120 (indicating hypoxemia) were compared with the third with a higher ratio. A total of 12 secondary analyses of prespecified outcomes were performed, and results of 9 of these are reported. Only one post hoc analysis was conducted; the results are reported.\nResults\nBaseline Characteristics\nWe enrolled 340 patients, of whom 178 were randomly assigned to cisatracurium and 162 to placebo. We excluded 986 patients (Figure 1). One patient in the cisatracurium group withdrew consent before treatment was started, and data for this patient were therefore not included in the analysis. The median time from the diagnosis of ARDS to study inclusion was 16 hours (interquartile range, 6 to 29) in the study population and did not differ significantly between the cisatracurium group (median, 18 hours; interquartile range, 6 to 31) and the placebo group (median, 15 hours; interquartile range, 7 to 27; P=0.45). The median time from initiation of mechanical ventilation to study inclusion did not differ significantly between the cisatracurium group (22 hours; interquartile range, 9 to 41) and the placebo group (21 hours; interquartile range, 10 to 42; P=0.91). The only significant difference between the two groups at baseline was a lower mean PaO2:FIO2 value in the cisatracurium group (P=0.03) (Table 2, and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nTable 2\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients, According to Study Group.\nOutcomes\nPrimary Outcome\nThe Cox regression model yielded a hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cis\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
