We evaluated the effect of early application of prone positioning on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS.\nMethods\nIn this multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned 466 patients with severe ARDS to undergo prone-positioning sessions of at least 16 hours or to be left in the supine position. Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of at least 0.6, a positive end-expiratory pressure of at least 5 cm of water, and a tidal volume close to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died from any cause within 28 days after inclusion.\nResults\nA total of 237 patients were assigned to the prone group, and 229 patients were assigned to the supine group. The 28-day mortality was 16.0% in the prone group and 32.8% in the supine group (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for death with prone positioning was 0.39 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.63). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was 23.6% in the prone group versus 41.0% in the supine group (P<0.001), with a hazard ratio of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29 to 0.67). The incidence of complications did not differ significantly between the groups, except for the incidence of cardiac arrests, which was higher in the supine group.\nConclusions\nIn patients with severe ARDS, early application of prolonged prone-positioning sessions significantly decreased 28-day and 90-day mortality.

Randomized, controlled trials have confirmed that oxygenation is significantly better when patients are in the prone position than when they are in the supine position.1,2 Furthermore, several lines of evidence have shown that prone positioning could prevent ventilator-induced lung injury.3–6 In several previous trials, these physiological benefits did not translate into better patient outcomes, since no significant improvement was observed in patient survival with prone positioning.7–10 However, meta-analyses2,11 have suggested that survival is significantly improved with prone positioning as compared with supine positioning among patients with severely hypoxemic ARDS at the time of randomization. We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial to explore whether early application of prone positioning would improve survival among patients with ARDS who, at the time of enrollment, were receiving mechanical ventilation with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of at least 5 cm of water and in whom the ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was less than 150 mm Hg.\nMethods\nPatients\nWe included in the study adults who met the following criteria: ARDS, as defined according to the American–European Consensus Conference criteria12; endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation for ARDS for less than 36 hours; and severe ARDS (defined as a PaO2:FiO2 ratio of <150 mm Hg, with an FiO2 of ≥0.6, a PEEP of ≥5 cm of water, and a tidal volume of about 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight; the criteria were confirmed after 12 to 24 hours of mechanical ventilation in the participating intensive care unit [ICU]). Exclusion criteria are listed in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nTrial Design\nPatients were recruited from 26 ICUs in France and 1 in Spain, all of which have used prone positioning in daily practice for more than 5 years. Randomization was computer-generated and stratified according to ICU. Patients were randomly assigned to the prone group or supine group with the use of a centralized Web-based management system (Clininfo). The protocol, available at NEJM.org, was approved by the ethics committee Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomedicale Sud-Est IV in Lyon, France, and by the Clinical Investigation Ethics Committee at Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona. Written informed consent was obtained after the patients' next of kin read the informational leaflet. If patients were able to read the leaflet at some point after inclusion in the study, they were approached to confirm participation in the trial. An investigator at each center was responsible for enrolling patients in the study, following the protocol, and completing the case-report form. Centers were regularly monitored by research fellows. Data collectors were aware of the study-group assignments, but outcomes assessors were not.\nThe trial was overseen by a steering committee that met monthly. An independent data and safety monitoring board, comprising three experts in the field, was also set up (a list of board members is provided in the Supplementary Appendix). There was no commercial support. No one who is not listed as an author contributed to the writing of this manuscript.
