The lung injury score was 3.3±0.4 in both groups, and the rate of use of noninvasive ventilation in the 24 hours before inclusion was similar in the two groups (29.3% and 30.8% in the supine and prone groups, respectively). Ventilator settings, respiratory-system mechanics, and results of arterial blood-gas measurements were also similar in the two groups (Table 2).\nTable 1\n\nCharacteristics of the Participants at Inclusion in the Study.\nTable 2\n\nVentilator Settings, Respiratory-System Mechanics, and Results of Arterial Blood Gas Measurements at the Time of Inclusion in the Study.\nProne Positioning\nPatients in the prone group underwent their first prone-positioning session within 55±55 minutes after randomization. The average number of sessions was 4±4 per patient, and the mean duration per session was 17±3 hours. All the patients in this group underwent at least one prone-positioning session. In the prone group, patients were ventilated in the prone position for 73% of the 22,334 patient-hours spent in the ICU from the start of the first session to the end of the last session.\nAdjunctive Therapies\nThe rates of the use of rescue therapies in the supine and prone groups were 2.6% versus 0.8% for ECMO (P=0.14), 15.7% versus 9.7% for inhaled nitric oxide (P=0.05), and 6.6% versus 2.5% for almitrine bismesylate (P=0.04). Neuromuscular blockers were used for 5.6±5.0 days in the supine group and 5.7±4.7 days in the prone group (P=0.74), and intravenous sedation was given for 9.5±6.8 and 10.1±7.2 days in the two groups, respectively (P=0.35). The use of antiviral therapy for H1N1 virus infection was similar in the two groups.\nVentilator Settings and Lung Function during the First Week\nThe PaO2:FiO2 ratio recorded in the supine position was significantly higher in the prone group than in the supine group at days 3 and 5, whereas the PEEP and FiO2 were significantly lower (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The PplatRS was 2 cm of water lower by day 3 in the prone group than in the supine group. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and static compliance of the respiratory system were similar in the two groups.\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes\nMortality at day 28 was significantly lower in the prone group than in the supine group: 16.0% (38 of 237 participants) versus 32.8% (75 of 229) (P<0.001) (Table 3). The significant difference in mortality persisted at day 90 (Table 3). A comparison of the two survival curves showed the same significant difference (Figure 2). After adjustment for the SOFA score and the use of neuromuscular blockers and vasopressors at the time of inclusion, mortality remained significantly lower in the prone group than in the supine group (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The rate of successful extubation was significantly higher in the prone group (Table 3). The duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the ICU, incidence of pneumothorax, rate of use of noninvasive ventilation after extubation, and tracheotomy rate did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 3).\nFigure 2\n\nKaplan–Meier Plot of the Probability of Survival from Randomization to Day 90.\nTable 3\n\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes According to Study Group.\nComplications\nA total of 31 cardiac arrests occurred in the supine group, and 16 in the prone group (P=0.02). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to other adverse effects (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nDiscussion\nSurvival after severe ARDS was significantly higher in the prone group than in the supine group. Furthermore, the effect size was large despite the fact that mortality in the supine group was lower than anticipated.\nOur results are consistent with findings from previous meta-analyses2,11 and an observational study,18 even though prior randomized trials have failed to show a survival benefit with prone positioning. Meta-analyses of ARDS studies have suggested that the outcomes with prone positioning are better in the subgroup of patients with severe hypoxemia.2,11 However, when we stratified our analysis according to quartile of PaO2:FiO2 ratio at enrollment, we found no significant differences in outcomes (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nSeveral factors may explain our results. First, patients with severe ARDS were selected on the basis of oxygenation together with PEEP and FiO2 levels. Second, patients were included after a 12-to-24-hour period during which the ARDS criteria were confirmed. This period may have contributed to the selection of patients with more severe ARDS19 who could benefit from the advantages of the prone positioning, such as relief of severe hypoxemia and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. A previous study has shown that prone positioning, as compared with supine positioning, markedly reduces the overinflated lung areas while promoting alveolar recruitment.5\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
