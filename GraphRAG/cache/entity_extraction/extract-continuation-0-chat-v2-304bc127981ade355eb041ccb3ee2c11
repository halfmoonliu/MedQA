We also recorded the number of lung quadrants involved on chest radiography, results of measurements of arterial blood gases, PplatRS, arterial blood lactate levels, the cause of ARDS, the Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score16 (which ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more severe organ failure), the lung injury score (which ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating more severe lung injury),17 and the time at which the first prone session was started.\nThe following events were recorded daily until day 28: attempts at extubation, administration of inhaled nitric oxide, infusion of almitrine bismesylate, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), infusion of sedatives and neuromuscular blockers, complications, and the SOFA score. Ventilator settings, PplatRS, static compliance of the respiratory system, and the results of measurements of arterial blood gases were recorded daily during the first week as indicated above. Data quality was verified by the research fellows, and data were stored in a database (Clininfo) that was specifically developed for the study with the use of Epi Info software, version 3.4.3.\nOutcome Measures\nThe primary end point was mortality at day 28. Secondary end points were mortality at day 90, the rate of successful extubation, the time to successful extubation, the length of stay in the ICU, complications, the use of noninvasive ventilation, the tracheotomy rate, the number of days free from organ dysfunction, and ventilator settings, measurements of arterial blood gases, and respiratory-system mechanics during the first week after randomization.\nSuccessful extubation was defined as no reintubation or use of noninvasive ventilation in the 48 hours after extubation. In patients who had undergone a tracheotomy, successful weaning from the ventilator was defined as the ability to breathe unassisted through the tracheostomy cannula for at least 24 hours.\nStatistical Analysis\nThe expected 28-day mortality in the supine group was 60%. We estimated that with a sample of 456 patients, the study would have 90% power to detect an absolute reduction of 15 percentage points (to 45%) with prone positioning, at a one-sided type I error rate of 5%.\nAn interim analysis was planned 28 days after half the patients had been enrolled, and two analyses were scheduled, each with a type I error rate set to 2.5% to maintain an overall type I error rate of 5%. The statistician sent the data from the interim analysis to the data and safety monitoring board, which had to decide whether to continue or discontinue the trial. An absolute difference in mortality of 25 percentage points or more between groups at the time of the interim analysis was the only criterion for early trial termination. There was no stopping rule for futility.\nThe analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Continuous variables were expressed as means with standard deviations. Data were compared between groups with the use of the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test and analysis of variance as indicated. Patient survival was analyzed with the use of the Kaplan–Meier method and compared between groups with the use of the log-rank test. Cox proportional-hazards regression, with stratification according to center, was planned to adjust the between-group differences in mortality at day 28 and day 90 for significant baseline covariates. The statistical analysis was performed with the use of SPSS software (SPSS for Windows, version 17.0). The investigators had no access to the database until the study was completed. All reported P values are two-sided, and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nResults\nParticipants\nFrom January 1, 2008, through July 25, 2011, a total of 3449 patients with ARDS were admitted to the participating ICUs, and 474 underwent randomization (Figure 1). Eight patients were subsequently excluded (Figure 1), and 466 patients were included in the analysis: 229 in the supine group and 237 in the prone group. After the interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the trial be continued.\nFigure 1\n\nEnrollment, Randomization, and Follow-up of the Study Participants.\nCharacteristics at Inclusion\nThe characteristics of the patients at inclusion in the study were similar in the two groups except for the SOFA score and the use of neuromuscular blockers and vasopressors (Table 1). In more than half the cases, the main cause of ARDS was pneumonia (Table 1). Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection was the main cause of ARDS in 28 patients, with no significant difference between the groups in the rate (5.7% in the supine group and 6.3% in the prone group, P=0.85). The mean (±SD) time from intubation to randomization was 31±26 hours in the supine group and 33±24 hours in the prone group (P=0.66). The lung injury score was 3.3±0.4 in both groups, and the rate of use of noninvasive ventilation in the 24 hours before inclusion was similar in the two groups (29.3% and 30.8% in the supine and prone groups\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLININFO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clininfo is a database specifically developed for the study to store data, using Epi Info software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EPI INFO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Epi Info is a software used to develop the Clininfo database for the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPSS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SPSS is a software used for statistical analysis in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARDS<|>EVENT<|>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a condition affecting patients in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INFLUENZA A (H1N1)<|>EVENT<|>A virus infection that was the main cause of ARDS in 28 patients in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPINE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients in the study who were positioned supine during treatment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRONE GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients in the study who were positioned prone during treatment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A board responsible for monitoring the data and safety of the trial, deciding whether to continue or discontinue the trial)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLININFO<|>EPI INFO<|>Clininfo was developed using Epi Info software<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPINE GROUP<|>PRONE GROUP<|>Both groups are part of the study comparing different patient positioning<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD<|>SUPINE GROUP<|>The board recommended the continuation of the trial involving the supine group<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD<|>PRONE GROUP<|>The board recommended the continuation of the trial involving the prone group<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARDS<|>INFLUENZA A (H1N1)<|>Influenza A (H1N1) was a main cause of ARDS in the study<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
