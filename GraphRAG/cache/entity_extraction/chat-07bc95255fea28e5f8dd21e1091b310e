In one earlier trial, the traditional tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 12.2 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and the lower tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 8.1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight.23 In a second study, the traditional and lower tidal volumes were approximately 10.3 and 7.1 ml per kilogram of dry body weight (calculated as the measured weight minus the estimated weight gain from fluid retention), respectively.22 In the present trial, measured weight exceeded predicted body weight by approximately 20 percent. Assuming a similar difference, and assuming that half the difference was dry weight in excess of predicted body weight, tidal volumes in the second trial would have been approximately 11.3 and 7.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. Therefore, the traditional tidal volume of 11.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight in our study was similar to the values in the previous two trials. However, the tidal volume of 6.2 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight in the group receiving lower tidal volumes was lower than the values in the previous two trials.\nIf one assumes that measured weights also exceeded predicted body weights by 20 percent in the earlier trials, the tidal volumes in the traditional groups were approximately 10.2 and 9.4 ml per kilogram of measured weight, respectively, as compared with 9.9 ml per kilogram of measured weight in our study. Therefore, the tidal volumes in the traditional groups in each of the three trials were consistent with traditional recommendations.6,36\nA second possible explanation for the different results is that the previous trials were designed to detect larger differences in mortality between groups.22â€“24 Hence, they lacked the statistical power to demonstrate the moderate effects of lower tidal volumes that we found.\nA third difference in the trials was in the treatment of acidosis. Increases in the ventilator rate were required and bicarbonate infusions were allowed to correct mild-to-moderate acidosis in our study, which resulted in smaller differences in the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH between the study groups than in the previous trials.22â€“24 The deleterious effects of acidosis in the previous studies may have counteracted a protective effect of the lower tidal volumes.\nIn addition to being caused by excessive stretch, lung injury may also result from repeated opening and closing of small airways or from excessive stress at margins between aerated and atelectatic regions of the lungs.37 These types of lung injury may be prevented by the use of a higher positive end-expiratory pressure.10,13,37,38 A slightly higher positive end-expiratory pressure was necessary in the group treated with lower tidal volumes during the first few days to maintain arterial oxygenation at a level similar to that in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes, but positive end-expiratory pressure was not increased as a means of protecting the lungs.\nIn a recent trial in 53 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 28-day mortality was significantly lower with a ventilation strategy that used a higher positive end-expiratory pressure combined with limited peak inspiratory pressure than with a strategy of traditional ventilation.21 These results suggest that both increased positive end-expiratory pressure and reduced inspiratory stretch could have beneficial effects.\nStretch-induced lung injury may not occur if lung compliance is not greatly reduced. However, the benefit of ventilation with a lower tidal volume was independent of the static compliance of the respiratory system at base line, suggesting that the lower tidal volume was advantageous regardless of lung compliance. Variations in chest-wall compliance, which contributes to compliance of the respiratory system and is reduced in many patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,39 may have obscured a true interaction between tidal volume and base-line lung compliance.\nBarotrauma occurred with similar frequency in the two study groups, a finding consistent with the results of other studies in which the incidence of barotrauma was independent of airway pressures.22â€“24,40,41 The most common manifestation of barotrauma was pneumothorax, which could have been the result of invasive procedures. Pneumothorax is not a sensitive or specific marker of stretch-induced injury with the tidal volumes used in this study.\nThe similarity in the number of days of ventilator use among the survivors in both groups suggests that the higher number of ventilator-free days in the group treated with lower tidal volumes resulted from reduced mortality rather than from a reduced number of days of ventilation among the survivors. However, the comparison of the number of days of ventilator use among the survivors could be misleading.42 Some patients who would have survived in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes might have needed the ventilator on fewer days had they been in the group treated with lower tidal volumes. This beneficial effect would have been obscured if prolonged ventilation was required before recovery among patients who otherwise would have died in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. For similar reasons, it is also difficult to compare the number of days with organ or system failure among the survivors in the two study groups.\nWe found that treatment with a ventilation approach designed to protect the lungs from excessive stretch resulted in improvements in several important clinical outcomes in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. On the basis of these results, high priority should be given to preventing excessive lung stretch during adjustments to mechanical ventilation, and this lower-tidal-volume protocol should be used in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nNotes\nSupported by contracts (NO1-HR 46054, 46055, 46056,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
