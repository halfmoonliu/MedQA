Physicians could institute any alternative therapy (including HFOV in the control group) for patients who met any one of the following criteria: refractory hypoxemia (PaO2 <60 mm Hg for 1 hour with an FiO2 of 1.0 and neuromuscular blockade), refractory barotrauma (persistent pneumothorax or increasing subcutaneous emphysema despite two thoracostomy tubes on the involved side), or refractory acidosis (pH of ≤7.05 despite neuromuscular blockade).\nPhysicians prescribed fluids, sedatives, and neuromuscular blockers at their discretion. We recorded cardiorespiratory variables daily as well as data on cointerventions applied while patients were undergoing mechanical ventilation for up to 60 days. Intensivists reviewed chest radiographs for evidence of new barotrauma. Patients were followed until their discharge from the hospital.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe anticipated that mortality in the control group would be 45%. Assuming a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, we calculated that enrollment of 1200 patients would provide at least 80% power to detect a relative-risk reduction with HFOV of 20%, even if mortality in the control group was as low as 37%.\nInvestigators reviewed feasibility data from the pilot phase, which involved 94 patients, but remained unaware of the clinical outcomes. The independent data monitoring committee reviewed the clinical outcomes from the pilot phase and recommended that the trial continue to the next phase. As originally planned, data from the patients involved in the pilot phase were included in the current analyses. In addition to an interim analysis after 800 patients had undergone randomization, safety analyses of physiological data at the initiation of the study were planned after 300, 500, and 700 patients had undergone randomization. After reviewing these safety data, the data monitoring committee could request analyses of in-hospital mortality, which they did after both the 300-patient and 500-patient safety analyses. With plans to stop the study early only in response to a strong signal of harm in association with the use of HFOV, we used the O'Brien–Fleming method to calculate alpha spending and generated one-sided P values for considering early stopping after random assignment of 300 patients (P≤0.00001), 500 patients (P≤0.0001), and 700 patients (P≤0.0064).\nWe used SAS software, version 9.2, for the statistical analyses. We summarized data using means with standard deviations, medians and interquartile ranges, or proportions. Normally distributed data were compared with the use of Student's t-test, nonnormally distributed data with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and proportions with the use of the Mantel–Haenszel chi-square test, with stratification according to center. We analyzed data from all patients according to their assigned group.\nThe primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, with the outcome compared between the two groups stratified according to center. Other than recording whether death occurred as a result of withdrawal of life support, we did not record specific causes of death. As a sensitivity analysis, we used logistic regression to adjust the treatment effect for prespecified baseline variables: age, the Acute Physiology Score component of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score,30 the presence or absence of sepsis, and the duration of hospitalization before randomization.9 To compare the two groups with respect to the time to death, we used a survival analysis, in which patients who were discharged alive from the hospital were assumed to be alive at day 60.\nWe conducted prespecified subgroup analyses to determine whether there were interactions of the treatment effect with baseline severity of lung injury (in quartiles of the PaO2:FiO2 ratio) or with center experience with HFOV and study protocols (in thirds of number of patients recruited). In addition, we studied interactions of the treatment effect with baseline dynamic compliance measured from tidal breaths during conventional ventilation (in quartiles), baseline body-mass index (in quartiles), and receipt or no receipt of vasopressors at baseline — all post hoc analyses.\nResults\nEarly Termination of the Trial\nAfter the 500-patient analysis, the steering committee terminated the trial, acting on a unanimous recommendation from the data monitoring committee, although the threshold P value for stopping had not been reached. At the time of termination, 571 patients had been enrolled, of whom 548 had undergone randomization: 275 to the HFOV group and 273 to the control-ventilation group (Figure 1). Important prognostic factors were similar in the two groups at baseline (Table 3, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).\nFigure 1\n\nScreening, Randomization, and Follow-up.\nTable 3\n\nBaseline Characteristics of the Patients.\nMortality\nA total of 129 patients (47%) in the HFOV group, as compared with 96 patients (35%) in the control group, died in the hospital (relative risk of death with HFOV, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.64; P=0.005) (Table 4 and Figure 2). The results were consistent in a multivariable analysis (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), in an analysis of mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU), and in an analysis of 28-day mortality. Subgroup analyses showed no interaction of mortality with baseline severity of hypoxemia, respiratory compliance, body-mass index, or use or nonuse of vasop\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PHYSICIANS<|>PERSON<|>Medical professionals responsible for prescribing treatments and monitoring patients in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTENSIVISTS<|>PERSON<|>Specialized physicians who reviewed chest radiographs for evidence of barotrauma in patients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVESTIGATORS<|>PERSON<|>Researchers who reviewed feasibility data from the pilot phase of the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A committee responsible for reviewing clinical outcomes and recommending the continuation of the trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEERING COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The committee that decided to terminate the trial based on recommendations from the data monitoring committee)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAS SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Software used for statistical analyses in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HFOV<|>EVENT<|>High-Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation, a treatment method evaluated in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTROL GROUP<|>EVENT<|>The group of patients receiving standard ventilation treatment in the study)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIAL<|>EVENT<|>The clinical study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of HFOV compared to standard ventilation)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHYSICIANS<|>INTENSIVISTS<|>Physicians and intensivists worked together to monitor and treat patients in the study<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INVESTIGATORS<|>INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE<|>Investigators provided data to the independent data monitoring committee for review<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE<|>STEERING COMMITTEE<|>The independent data monitoring committee recommended trial continuation to the steering committee<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SAS SOFTWARE<|>TRIAL<|>SAS Software was used for statistical analyses in the trial<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HFOV<|>CONTROL GROUP<|>HFOV and the control group were the two treatment methods compared in the trial<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIAL<|>STEERING COMMITTEE<|>The steering committee decided to terminate the trial<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
