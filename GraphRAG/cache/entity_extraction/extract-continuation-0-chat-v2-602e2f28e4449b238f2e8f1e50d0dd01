Although we excluded patients whose Pao2:Fio2 improved to more than 200 mm Hg before randomization, we may also have recruited some patients with lung injury that was either rapidly improving or less established than that observed in the previous trial. However, analyses stratified according to the time from the onset of ARDS to enrollment did not suggest any between-group difference in the rate of improvement in oxygenation or treatment effect. The unexpected interaction between Hispanic ethnic group and treatment may be the result of random chance.\nOur trial has limitations. The most common reason eligible patients were excluded was that they had previously received neuromuscular blockade. It is possible that treating physicians were identifying and treating a subset of patients who were more likely to benefit from neuromuscular blockade use. However, there was no evidence of benefit even when analyses were restricted to trial sites that rarely excluded those patients. We did not systematically measure the effect of neuromuscular blockade on ventilator dyssynchrony. However, in patients with ARDS or at risk for ARDS, neuromuscular blockade essentially eliminates ventilator dyssynchrony.43 Finally, nurses, physiotherapists, and other health care professionals were aware of the treatment assignments. This lack of blinding may have influenced short-term assessments of early neuromuscular function, the level of physical activity, and the reporting of adverse events. In conclusion, among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a higher PEEP strategy, the administration of an early and continuous infusion of cisatracurium did not result in significantly lower mortality at 90 days than usual care with lighter sedation targets.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ARDS<|>EVENT<|>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a severe lung condition that requires medical intervention)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HISPANIC ETHNIC GROUP<|>PERSON<|>A demographic group mentioned in the context of treatment interaction in the trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CISATRACURIUM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A neuromuscular blocking agent used in the trial for patients with ARDS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRIAL SITES<|>GEO<|>Locations where the clinical trial was conducted)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARDS<|>CISATRACURIUM<|>Cisatracurium was used as a treatment in the trial for patients with ARDS<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HISPANIC ETHNIC GROUP<|>ARDS<|>The trial noted an unexpected interaction between the Hispanic ethnic group and treatment for ARDS<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRIAL SITES<|>CISATRACURIUM<|>Trial sites were locations where Cisatracurium was administered to patients<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
