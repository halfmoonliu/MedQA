Martin and coworkers11 randomly assigned 37 patients with hypoproteinemia and acute lung injury to receive either a five-day specified regimen of furosemide and colloid replacement or placebo infusions. The treated group had an increase in the PaO2:FiO2 within 24 hours. We do not know whether using lung-water measurements to drive protocol instructions or increasing the use of colloid would have increased the benefits of the conservative strategy in our study.\nThe hemodynamic consequences of the conservative strategy were small and apparently of minimal clinical significance. Although the mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index were slightly lower in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group, there were no significant differences in mixed venous oxygenation or in the incidence or duration of shock. Although the conservative strategy was associated with a slightly higher blood urea nitrogen level, the creatinine level, the number of days without renal failure, and the need for dialysis were similar in the two groups. Possible reasons for the greater number of days without central nervous system failure in the conservative-strategy group include a reduced incidence of cerebral edema, differences in acid–base status, or a lower rate of use of sedation as improved lung function permitted earlier removal from the ventilator. The available data are not sufficient to distinguish among these or other potential explanations.\nThe protocols were designed to minimize risks. During shock, physicians treated patients according to their usual practice. Because of concern that a conservative approach might worsen cardiovascular or renal function, diuretic administration was suspended until 12 hours after a fluid bolus or the reversal of shock, and prompt fluid administration was provided in the event of oliguria or ineffective circulation. Diuretic therapy was titrated on the basis of the patient's response, avoided in patients with worsening renal function, and limited to a daily maximum. To minimize the risk of excessive fluid therapy, protocol-mandated fluid administration in patients without shock was limited to three boluses per day and was withheld in patients without shock who had severe hypoxemia (FiO2≥0.7) or a cardiac index of at least 4.5 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area.\nElectrolyte levels were managed by the clinician. The conservative-strategy group had a higher partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and bicarbonate level than did the liberal-strategy group. Although mean differences between the groups in the serum sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels were small, a higher percentage of patients in the conservative-strategy group had at least one potassium value between 2.5 and 3.0 mmol per liter, at least one sodium value of 150 mmol per liter or more, and at least one bicarbonate value of 40 mmol per liter or more. Hence, close monitoring of electrolyte levels is warranted during diuretic therapy.\nSince we tested specific management strategies that used several variables and safeguards, we do not know whether the safety and benefit of the conservative protocol could be realized by using the simplified target of a zero fluid balance. Departures from the specific hemodynamic and ventilator protocols used in this trial may lead to clinical outcomes that differ from those observed in this study.\nIn conclusion, we found that use of a conservative fluid-management protocol with a lower central venous pressure or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure target resulted in a major reduction in net fluid balance without an increase in adverse events, as compared with a liberal fluid-management protocol targeting higher intravascular filling pressures. Although we did not detect a difference in the mortality rate between the two approaches, the conservative strategy improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care, without increasing nonpulmonary organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
