Patients were randomly assigned to receive mechanical ventilation involving either traditional tidal volumes or lower tidal volumes.\nVentilator Procedures\nThe volume-assist–control mode was used for the ventilator until the patient was weaned from the device or for 28 days after randomization on day 0. Because normal lung volumes are predicted on the basis of sex and height,26,27 a predicted body weight was calculated for each patient from these data.28 The predicted body weight of male patients was calculated as equal to 50 + 0.91(centimeters of height – 152.4); that of female patients was calculated as equal to 45.5 + 0.91(centimeters of height – 152.4). In the group treated with traditional tidal volumes, the initial tidal volume was 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. This was subsequently reduced stepwise by 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight if necessary to maintain the airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) at a level of 50 cm of water or less. The minimal tidal volume was 4 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. If the plateau pressure dropped below 45 cm of water, the tidal volume was increased in steps of 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight until the plateau pressure was at least 45 cm of water or the tidal volume was 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight.\nIn the group treated with lower tidal volumes, the tidal volume was reduced to 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight within four hours after randomization and was subsequently reduced stepwise by 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight if necessary to maintain plateau pressure at a level of no more than 30 cm of water. The minimal tidal volume was 4 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. If plateau pressure dropped below 25 cm of water, tidal volume was increased in steps of 1 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight until the plateau pressure was at least 25 cm of water or the tidal volume was 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. For patients with severe dyspnea, the tidal volume could be increased to 7 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight if the plateau pressure remained 30 cm of water or less.\nPlateau pressures were measured with a half-second inspiratory pause at four-hour intervals and after changes in the tidal volume or positive end-expiratory pressure. Plateau pressures of more than 50 cm of water in the patients in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and of more than 30 cm of water in patients in the group treated with lower tidal volumes were allowed if the tidal volume was 4 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight or if arterial pH was less than 7.15.\nAll other objectives and ventilation procedures, including weaning, were identical in the two study groups (Table 1). If a patient became able to breathe without assistance but subsequently required additional mechanical ventilation within a period of 28 days, the same tidal-volume protocol was resumed.\nTable 1\n\nSummary of Ventilator Procedures.\nOrgan or System Failure\nPatients were monitored daily for 28 days for signs of the failure of nonpulmonary organs and systems.29 Circulatory failure was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or the need for treatment with any vasopressor; coagulation failure as a platelet count of 80,000 per cubic millimeter or less; hepatic failure as a serum bilirubin concentration of at least 2 mg per deciliter (34 μmol per liter); and renal failure as a serum creatinine concentration of at least 2 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter). We calculated the number of days without organ or system failure by subtracting the number of days with organ failure from the lesser of 28 days or the number of days to death. Organs and systems were considered failure-free after patients were discharged from the hospital.\nPlasma Interleukin-6 Concentrations\nBlood samples were obtained from 204 of the first 234 patients on day 0 and on day 3 for measurement of plasma interleukin-6 by immunoassay (R & D Systems, Minneapolis).30 Blood samples were stored in sterile EDTA-treated glass tubes.\nData Collection\nData on demographic, physiologic, and radiographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, and medications were recorded within four hours before the ventilator settings were changed on day 0. Physiologic and radiographic data, medication use, and use of other investigational treatments were recorded between 6\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LAKE CITY<|>GEO<|>Lake City is mentioned as a location in the context of medical criteria for patient exclusion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>R & D SYSTEMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>R & D Systems is a company based in Minneapolis that provided the immunoassay for measuring plasma interleukin-6)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINNEAPOLIS<|>GEO<|>Minneapolis is the location of R & D Systems, the company that provided the immunoassay for measuring plasma interleukin-6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>R & D SYSTEMS<|>MINNEAPOLIS<|>R & D Systems is located in Minneapolis<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
