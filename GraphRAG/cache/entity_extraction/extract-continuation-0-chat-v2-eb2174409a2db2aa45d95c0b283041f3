The mortality rate was 39.8 percent in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and 31.0 percent in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (P=0.007; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between groups, 2.4 to 15.3 percent). The interaction between the study group and stratification for other experimental interventions was not significant (P=0.16).\nFigure 1\n\nProbability of Survival and of Being Discharged Home and Breathing without Assistance during the First 180 Days after Randomization in Patients with Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.\nData were available to calculate the static compliance of the respiratory system at base line in 517 patients (Figure 2). The interaction between the quartile of static compliance at base line and the study group with respect to the risk of death was not significant (P=0.49).\nFigure 2\n\nMean (+SE) Mortality Rate among 257 Patients with Acute Lung Injury and the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Who Were Assigned to Receive Traditional Tidal Volumes and 260 Such Patients Who Were Assigned to Receive Lower Tidal Volumes, According to the Quartile of Static Compliance of the Respiratory System before Randomization.\nThe number of ventilator-free days was significantly higher in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (Table 4). The median duration of ventilation was 8 days among patients in both groups who were discharged from the hospital after weaning and 10.5 and 10 days, respectively, among those who died in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. The number of days without nonpulmonary organ or system failure was significantly higher in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (P=0.006). This group had more days without circulatory failure (mean [±SD], 19±10 vs. 17±11 days; P=0.004), coagulation failure (21±10 vs. 19±11 days, P=0.004), and renal failure (20±11 vs. 18±11 days, P=0.005) than did the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. The incidence of barotrauma after randomization was similar in the two groups.\nTable 4\n\nMain Outcome Variables.\nThere were no significant differences between groups in the percentages of days on which neuromuscular-blocking drugs were used among patients who were discharged home and breathing without assistance (6±14 percent in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and 6±15 percent in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes) or among those who died (20±32 percent and 16±28 percent, respectively), or in the percentages of days on which sedatives were used among patients who were discharged home and breathing without assistance (65±26 percent and 65±24 percent, respectively) or those who died (73±24 percent and 71±28 percent, respectively). Investigational treatments for acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome that were not included in the factorial design of the experimental interventions were given to 15 patients in the group treated with lower tidal volumes and 12 patients in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. These included prone positioning in 14 and 9 patients, respectively.\nThe mean log-transformed plasma interleukin-6 values decreased from 2.5±0.7 pg per milliliter on day 0 to 2.3±0.7 pg per milliliter on day 3 in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes and from 2.5±0.7 pg per milliliter to 2.0±0.5 pg per milliliter in the group treated with lower tidal volumes. The decrease was greater in the group treated with lower tidal volumes (P<0.001), and the day 3 plasma interleukin-6 concentrations were also lower in this group (P=0.002).\nDiscussion\nIn this large study of patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mortality was reduced by 22 percent and the number of ventilator-free days was greater in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes. These results are consistent with the results of experiments in animals9–14 and observational studies in humans.16,17\nThese benefits occurred despite the higher requirements for positive end-expiratory pressure and fraction of inspired oxygen and the lower ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen in the group treated with lower tidal volumes on days 1 and 3. These results, coupled with the greater reductions in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations, suggest that the group treated with lower tidal volumes had less lung inflammation.35 The greater reductions in plasma interleukin-6 concentrations may also reflect a reduced systemic inflammatory response to lung injury, which could contribute to the higher number of days without organ or system failure and the lower mortality in the group treated with lower tidal volumes.15\nSeveral factors could explain the difference in results between our trial and other trials of ventilation using lower tidal volumes in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome.22–24 First, our study had a greater difference in tidal volumes between groups. In one earlier trial, the traditional tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 12.2 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and the lower tidal volume was equivalent to approximately 8.1 ml per\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>EVENT<|>Acute Lung Injury is a medical condition characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME<|>EVENT<|>Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome is a severe condition characterized by sudden respiratory failure due to fluid buildup in the lungs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOWER TIDAL VOLUMES<|>EVENT<|>Lower tidal volumes refer to a ventilation strategy that uses smaller breaths to reduce lung injury in patients with respiratory distress)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRADITIONAL TIDAL VOLUMES<|>EVENT<|>Traditional tidal volumes refer to a ventilation strategy that uses larger breaths, which may increase the risk of lung injury in patients with respiratory distress)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOWER TIDAL VOLUMES<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>Lower tidal volumes were used as a treatment strategy for patients with acute lung injury<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOWER TIDAL VOLUMES<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME<|>Lower tidal volumes were used as a treatment strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRADITIONAL TIDAL VOLUMES<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>Traditional tidal volumes were used as a treatment strategy for patients with acute lung injury<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRADITIONAL TIDAL VOLUMES<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME<|>Traditional tidal volumes were used as a treatment strategy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOWER TIDAL VOLUMES<|>TRADITIONAL TIDAL VOLUMES<|>The study compared the effects of lower tidal volumes and traditional tidal volumes on patients<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
