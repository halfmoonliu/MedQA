We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients.\nMethods\nPatients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28.\nResults\nThe trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [±SD], 12±11 vs. 10±11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2±0.8 and 11.8±0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P<0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25±6 and 33±8 cm of water (P<0.001), respectively.\nConclusions\nIn patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use.\nThe mortality rate from acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome1 is approximately 40 to 50 percent.2–4 Although substantial progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms of acute lung injury,5 there has been little progress in developing effective treatments.\nTraditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight.6 These volumes are larger than those in normal subjects at rest (range, 7 to 8 ml per kilogram), but they are frequently necessary to achieve normal values for the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH. Since atelectasis and edema reduce aerated lung volumes in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,7,8 inspiratory airway pressures are often high, suggesting the presence of excessive distention, or “stretch,” of the aerated lung. In animals, ventilation with the use of large tidal volumes caused the disruption of pulmonary epithelium and endothelium, lung inflammation, atelectasis, hypoxemia, and the release of inflammatory mediators.9–14 The release of inflammatory mediators could increase lung inflammation and cause injury to other organs.10,15 Thus, the traditional approach to mechanical ventilation may exacerbate or perpetuate lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome and increase the risk of nonpulmonary organ or system failure.\nThe use of lower tidal volumes during ventilation in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome may reduce injurious lung stretch and the release of inflammatory mediators.16–18 However, this approach may cause respiratory acidosis16,17 and decrease arterial oxygenation19,20 and may therefore require changes in the priority of some objectives in the care of these patients. With the traditional approach, the attainment of normal partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and pH is given a higher priority than is protection of the lung from excessive stretch. With an approach that involves lower tidal volumes, the reverse is true. Uncontrolled studies suggested that the use of a lower tidal volume would reduce mortality in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome,17 but the results of four randomized trials of lung-protecting ventilation strategies have been conflicting.21–24 The present trial was conducted to determine whether the use of a lower tidal volume with mechanical ventilation would improve important clinical outcomes in such patients.\nMethods\nPatients\nPatients were recruited from March 1996 through March 1999 at the 10 university centers of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (the centers are listed in the Appendix). The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each hospital, and informed consent was obtained from the patients or surrogates at all but one hospital, where this requirement was waived. A complete description of the methods is available on the World Wide Web (at www.ardsnet.org) or from the National Auxiliary Publications Service (NAPS).\nPatients who were intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation were eligible for the study if they had an acute decrease in the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen to 300 or less (indicating the onset of hypoxemia; values were adjusted for altitude in Denver and Salt Lake City), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on a chest radiograph consistent with the presence of edema, and no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension or (if measured) a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure of 18 mm Hg or less.1 Patients were excluded if 36 hours had elapsed since they met the first three criteria; they were younger than 18 years of age; they had participated in other trials within 30 days before the first three criteria were met; they were pregnant; they\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME NETWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A network of 10 university centers involved in conducting the trial on mechanical ventilation for acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The institute that oversees the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network and supported the trial)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DENVER<|>GEO<|>A city where altitude adjustments were made for the trial's oxygenation criteria)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALT LAKE CITY<|>GEO<|>Another city where altitude adjustments were made for the trial's oxygenation criteria)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>EVENT<|>A condition characterized by acute respiratory distress and lung inflammation, targeted in the trial for improved ventilation strategies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME<|>EVENT<|>A severe lung condition causing respiratory failure, targeted in the trial for improved ventilation strategies)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME NETWORK<|>NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE<|>The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network is part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DENVER<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME NETWORK<|>Altitude adjustments for oxygenation criteria were made in Denver for the trial conducted by the network<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALT LAKE CITY<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME NETWORK<|>Altitude adjustments for oxygenation criteria were made in Salt Lake City for the trial conducted by the network<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACUTE LUNG INJURY<|>ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME<|>Both conditions were targeted in the trial for improved mechanical ventilation strategies<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
