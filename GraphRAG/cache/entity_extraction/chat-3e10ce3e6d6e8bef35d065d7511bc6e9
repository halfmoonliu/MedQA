The proportion of deaths after withdrawal of life support was similar in the two groups (55% [71 of 129 patients] in the HFOV group and 49% [47 of 96 patients] in the control group, P=0.12). The rate of new-onset barotrauma was higher in the HFOV group than in the control group, but the difference was not significant (18% and 13%, respectively; P=0.13). Among survivors, the duration of ventilation and the length of stay in the ICU were similar in the two groups (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nThe main finding of this multicenter, randomized trial is that among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, early application of HFOV was associated with higher mortality than was a ventilation strategy that used small tidal volumes and high PEEP levels, with HFOV used only in patients with severe refractory hypoxemia. HFOV was associated with higher mean airway pressures and with greater use of sedatives, neuromuscular blockers, and vasoactive drugs.\nWe stopped the trial early on the basis of a strong signal for increased mortality with HFOV, even though the prespecified stopping thresholds had not been reached. Studies that are stopped early on the basis of harm (or benefit) typically overestimate the magnitude of effect.31 We chose to terminate the study for three reasons: there was a consistent finding of increased mortality with HFOV in three consecutive analyses that were conducted after enrollment of 94, 300, and 500 patients; the increased need for vasoactive drugs in the HFOV group suggested a mechanism of harm that was not offset by better oxygenation and lung recruitment; and the effect size was sufficiently large that we concluded that even if early HFOV did not increase mortality, it would be very unlikely to decrease mortality. We believe that continued enrollment would have put patients at risk with little likelihood of benefit.\nOur results are inconsistent with the physiological rationale for HFOV and with the results of studies in animals. In studies in animals in which benefits of HFOV were observed, lung injury was induced with the use of saline lavage — a highly recruitable model of surfactant deficiency — which our results suggest does not translate directly to human adults with ARDS, in whom recruitability can be heterogeneous.32 Our results also contrast with those of prior randomized trials involving adults.22 A possible explanation, which provided motivation for our trial, is that prior studies used control ventilation strategies that are now known to be potentially harmful.20,21 We found no benefit with HFOV when a current ventilation strategy was used as a control. This finding of no benefit with respect to mortality is consistent with the results of another trial now reported in the Journal; in that trial, conducted in the United Kingdom, current standards for lung protection were suggested but not mandated.33 More surprising was our finding of harm. Several plausible mechanisms may contribute to increased mortality with HFOV. Higher mean airway pressures may result in hemodynamic compromise by decreasing venous return or directly affecting right ventricular function.34 Increased use of vasodilating sedative agents may also contribute to hemodynamic compromise. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility of increased barotrauma in association with HFOV.\nThe HFOV strategy that we chose, which was supported by preclinical data15,16 and a prospective physiological study,24 aimed to adjust mean airway pressure on the deflation limb of the volume-pressure curve and use the highest frequency possible to limit oscillatory volumes. This approach led to relatively high mean airway pressures, even considering that when mean airway pressures are delivered with a ratio of inspiratory-to-expiratory time of 1:2, as in our study, the pressures measured at the airway opening during HFOV are somewhat higher than those measured in the trachea.35–37 It is possible that an HFOV protocol that uses lower mean airway pressures, a different ratio of inspiratory-to-expiratory time, or a lower oscillatory frequency might have led to different results.\nThe strengths of this trial include its methodologic rigor, the application of protocols designed to open lung units in patients in both groups on the basis of the best available evidence, and enrollment at centers in several countries, which enhances the generalizability of our findings. Because we were cognizant that there is a learning curve associated with the use of HFOV,38,39 we enrolled most patients at centers that were experienced with HFOV, and we did not detect an interaction between treatment effect and the number of enrolled patients per site.\nOur results raise serious concerns about the early use of HFOV for the management of ARDS in adults. The results of this study increase the uncertainty about possible benefits of HFOV even when applied in patients with life-threatening refractory hypoxemia.\nIn conclusion, in adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS, the early application of HFOV targeting lung recruitment — as compared with a ventilation strategy that uses\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
