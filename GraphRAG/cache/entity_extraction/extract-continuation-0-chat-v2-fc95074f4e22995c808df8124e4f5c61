More furosemide was given to the conservative-strategy group (Table 2). Dobutamine use was similar and uncommon in both groups (4 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 6 percent in the conservative-strategy group). At least one blood transfusion was given to 29 percent of patients in the conservative-strategy group and to 39 percent of patients in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). During the study, there was no significant difference in the use of drotrecogin alfa (19 percent in the conservative-strategy group vs. 21 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.70) or systemic corticosteroids (32 percent vs. 37 percent, P=0.09).\nTable 2\n\nFurosemide Dose, Fluid Intake, Fluid Output, and Fluid Balance on Each Day during the Study.\nFluid Balance\nEach study day the liberal-strategy group received more fluid than the conservative-strategy group and on days 1 through 4 had a lower urinary output, resulting in a higher cumulative fluid balance (Table 2). During the study, the seven-day cumulative fluid balance was –136±491 ml in the conservative-strategy group, as compared with 6992±502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001) (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). For patients who were in shock at baseline, the cumulative seven-day fluid balance was 2904±1008 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 10,138±922 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). For patients who were not in shock at baseline, the cumulative fluid balance was −1576±519 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 5287±576 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001).\nHemodynamics\nIntravascular pressures declined in the conservative-strategy group but remained essentially unchanged in the liberal-strategy group (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had a slightly lower mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index, but the heart rate, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and percentage of patients receiving vasopressors did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 2A in the Supplementary Appendix). For patients in shock at randomization, approximately 40 percent of subsequent measurements met the criteria for shock in both treatment groups. For patients who were not in shock at baseline, there were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of shock during study (32 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 28 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.29) or in the proportions of protocol reassessments classified as shock (6 percent and 7 percent, respectively; P=0.78).\nLung Function\nVentilator settings and lung-function data are shown in Table 2B of the Supplementary Appendix. The conservative-strategy group had better lung injury scores and oxygenation indexes, as well as lower plateau pressures and positive end-expiratory pressures. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and the PaO2:FiO2 were slightly higher in the conservative-strategy group on all study days, but this difference did not reach significance for the PaO2:FiO2 (P=0.07).\nMetabolic and Renal Function\nThe conservative-strategy group had slightly higher creatinine values than the liberal-strategy group during the study, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.06) (Table 2C of the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, albumin, and calculated colloid osmotic pressure during the study.21 There were no significant differences in mean serum sodium levels during the study.\nSafety\nMetabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalances were reported as an adverse event (none with associated arrhythmias) more frequently with the conservative strategy (42 events, 3 serious) than with the liberal strategy (19 events, 1 serious) (P=0.001). More patients in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group had at least one potassium value of 3.0 mmol per liter or less (26 percent vs. 22 percent, P<0.001), one sodium value of at least 150 mmol per liter (25 percent vs. 18 percent, P=0.009), or one bicarbonate value of more than 40 mmol per liter (6 percent vs. 2 percent, P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with at least one potassium value of 2.5 mmol per liter or less (4 percent vs. 3 percent, P=0.23).\nMajor Outcomes\nMajor outcomes are shown in Table 3 and Figure 3. There was no interaction between the interventions of the factorial design (type of fluid management and type of catheter, P=0.26). Therefore, results are reported according to the fluid-management strategy, irrespective of catheter assignment. The in-hospital death rate during the first 60 days after randomization was 25.5±1.9 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4±2.0 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, −2.6 to 8.4 percent). The conservative-strategy group had more ventilator-free days, days free of central nervous system failure, and ICU-free days during the first 28 days. There were no significant differences\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CONSERVATIVE-STRATEGY GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients in a study receiving a conservative fluid management strategy, characterized by lower fluid intake and different medical outcomes compared to the liberal-strategy group)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBERAL-STRATEGY GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A group of patients in a study receiving a liberal fluid management strategy, characterized by higher fluid intake and different medical outcomes compared to the conservative-strategy group)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONSERVATIVE-STRATEGY GROUP<|>LIBERAL-STRATEGY GROUP<|>Both groups are part of a study comparing different fluid management strategies and their effects on patients<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
