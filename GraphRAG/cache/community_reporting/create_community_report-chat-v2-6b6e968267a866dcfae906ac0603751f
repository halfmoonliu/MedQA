It is characterized by an overwhelming immune response to infection, leading to dangerously low blood pressure, significant hemodynamic effects, and organ dysfunction or failure. This condition often requires intensive care, including mechanical ventilation and treatment with vasopressors such as dopamine, norepinephrine, or vasopressin. Septic shock is associated with high mortality rates and is a major risk factor for atrial fibrillation. It involves life-threatening circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities due to a dysregulated host response to infection. The condition is frequently studied in clinical trials, including those focusing on corticosteroid and hydrocortisone treatments, and was a primary focus of the APROCCHSS trial, which aimed to treat sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate volume status. The study also compared transfusion thresholds in the ICU setting and assessed cardiovascular dysfunction as part of its criteria. Despite the severity of septic shock, no significant difference in mortality was observed between treatments with dopamine and norepinephrine in the trials.\",70\n142,SEVERE SEPSIS,\"Severe sepsis is a critical and life-threatening medical condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to a known or suspected infection, which often leads to acute organ dysfunction. This condition can progress to septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively. Severe sepsis typically requires intensive care treatment due to its severity and complexity. It was the focus of a study where patients received either Drotrecogin Alfa Activated or a placebo. The study highlighted that Drotrecogin Alfa Activated is used to treat severe sepsis and is associated with a significant reduction in mortality. The condition's defining features include a generalized inflammatory and procoagulant response to infection, making it a major criterion for patient eligibility in related clinical studies.\",17\n342,ATRIAL FIBRILLATION,\"Atrial fibrillation is a type of arrhythmia and a cardiac adverse event that was notably more common in the high-target group in the study.
