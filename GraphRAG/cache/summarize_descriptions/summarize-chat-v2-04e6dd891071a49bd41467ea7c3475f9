{"result": "The Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare two groups. It is particularly useful for comparing secondary outcomes in studies where the data may not meet the assumptions required for parametric tests. This test is often employed when the data are ordinal or when the sample sizes are small, providing a robust alternative to the t-test for independent samples.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
