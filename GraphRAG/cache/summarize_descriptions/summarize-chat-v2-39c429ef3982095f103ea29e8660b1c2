{"result": "Fisher's Exact Test is a statistical significance test primarily used in the analysis of contingency tables. It is employed in studies to compare baseline variables and secondary outcomes, as well as to determine if there are nonrandom associations between two categorical variables. This test is particularly useful in research settings where the sample size is small, and it provides a precise method for evaluating the association between categorical variables.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
