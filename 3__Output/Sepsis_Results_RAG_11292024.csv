Context Septic shock may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency. Thus, a replacement therapy of low doses of corticosteroids has been proposed to treat septic shock.

Objective To assess whether low doses of corticosteroids improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency.

Design and Setting Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial performed in 19 intensive care units in France from October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999.

Patients Three hundred adult patients who fulfilled usual criteria for septic shock were enrolled after undergoing a short corticotropin test.

Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone (50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50-µg tablet once daily) (n = 151) or matching placebos (n = 149) for 7 days.

Main Outcome Measure Twenty-eight-day survival distribution in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (nonresponders to the corticotropin test).

Results One patient from the corticosteroid group was excluded from analyses because of consent withdrawal. There were 229 nonresponders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36). In nonresponders, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.95; P = .02). Vasopressor therapy was withdrawn within 28 days in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.84; P = .001). There was no significant difference between groups in responders. Adverse events rates were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion In our trial, a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events.

Severe sepsis remains an important cause of death, accounting for 9.3% of all deaths in the United States in 1995.1 If our understanding of the mechanisms of host response to stress has strongly progressed during the last 2 decades,2 the various drugs developed for specific targets of the cytokine cascade have failed to improve patient survival.3,4

Corticosteroids were the first anti-inflammatory drugs tested in randomized trials. At high doses during short courses, they did not induce favorable effects.5,6 However, the observation that severe sepsis may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency7,8 or systemic inflammation-induced glucocorticoid receptor resistance9 prompted renewed interest of a replacement therapy with low doses of corticosteroids during longer periods.10,11

The interest of this new approach was confirmed by the demonstration that a single intravenous administration of 50 mg of hydrocortisone strongly improved norepinephrine and phenylephrine mean arterial pressure dose-response relationships in patients with septic shock,12,13 particularly in those with relative adrenal insufficiency.12 Moreover, 2 small placebo-controlled randomized trials also showed that prolonged treatment (≥5 days) with low doses of hydrocortisone (about 300 mg daily) significantly improved the time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Thus, we designed this placebo-controlled study to assess whether a replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (assuming the possibility of a primary adrenal insufficiency)16 could improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock, with particular interest in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency.

Methods
Experimental Design and Study Organization
This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed on 2 parallel groups at 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in France (Figure 1). It was supported by Groupe d'Etude et de Recherche sur le Médicament (GERMED), which awarded a grant from publicly funded resources. The protocol was approved by the Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale of Saint-Germain en Laye, France, on February 9, 1995. Inclusions were authorized from September 11, 1995. Two interim analyses were planned. An independent main end point and safety monitoring board met after each interim analysis to decide whether the study should be continued or stopped. Enrollment ended March 15, 1999. At the end of the study, an independent diagnosis validation committee blindly classified each patient as being unquestionable, probable, or nonprobable for having had septic shock.

Patients
All patients 18 years or older and hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all the following criteria: (1) documented site (or at least strong suspicion) of infection, as evidenced by one or more of the following: presence of polymorphs in a normally sterile body fluid (except blood), positive culture or Gram stain of a normally sterile body fluid, clinical focus of infection (eg, fecal peritonitis), wound with purulent discharge, pneumonia or other clinical evidence of systemic infection (eg, purpura fulminans); (2) temperature higher than 38.3°C or lower than 35.6°C; (3) heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute; (4) systolic arterial pressure lower than 90 mm Hg for at least 1 hour despite adequate fluid replacement and more than 5 µg/kg of body weight of dopamine or current treatment with epinephrine or norepinephrine; (5) urinary output of less than 0.5 mL/kg of body weight for at least 1 hour or ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) of less than 280 mm Hg; (6) arterial lactate levels higher than 2 mmol/L; and (7) need for mechanical ventilation. Written informed consent had to be obtained from the patients themselves or their relatives and a short corticotropin test had to be performed before randomization. Finally, patients had to be randomized within 3 hours of the onset of shock.

Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or had evidence for acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, advanced form of cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection, and contraindication or formal indication for corticosteroids.

During recruitment, we refined the eligibility criteria by not making the arterial lactate requirement mandatory (the 6th criterion) but adding it as an option to the 5th criterion. We also increased the maximum delay from the onset of septic shock and randomization from 3 to 8 hours (amendment of July 18, 1996); and we excluded patients who received etomidate during the 6 hours preceding randomization because it is a selective inhibitor of the 11 β-hydroxylase and therefore could interfere with cortisol response to corticotropin (amendment of June 19, 1997).

Randomization
Randomization was centrally performed, concealed, and stratified by center in blocks of 4 according to a computer-generated random number table. In each center, sequentially numbered boxes containing the whole treatment for each patient were delivered to the investigator by the pharmacist following the order of the randomization list. All patients, medical and nursing staffs, and pharmacists remained blinded throughout the study period.

Treatments
Hydrocortisone came in vials containing 100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules containing 2 mL of glucose solution solvent, which was administered intravenously every 6 hours as a 50-mg bolus (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France). One tablet containing 50 µg of 9-α-fludrocortisone was administered daily through a nasogastric tube with 10 to 40 mL of water over 30 seconds (Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux, Paris, France). Placebos were indiscernible from active treatments. Treatment duration was 7 days.

Data Collection at Inclusion
Clinical Evaluation
The following data were recorded: (1) general characteristics including estimated prognosis of any underlying disease17 and level of activity limitation18; (2) severity of illness assessed by vital signs, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II),19 and Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score20; and (3) interventions including the volume of fluid infusion and the type and doses of vasopressors and antibiotics.

Laboratory Variables
Hematological and chemistry data, arterial lactate and blood gas determinations, and blood cultures and cultures of specimen drawn from the site of infection were done systematically. The short corticotropin test was performed using a 250-µg intravenous bolus of tetracosactrin (Synacthène Ciba, Rueil-Malmaison, France). Blood samples were taken immediately before the test and 30 and 60 minutes after the test. After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at −80°C until assayed. Cortisol was measured blindly and serially before interim and final statistical analyses using Immunotech radioimmunoassay.21 To reduce heterogeneity in cortisol determination, all plasma samples were measured at a central laboratory. Cortisol response was defined as the difference between the highest of the concentrations taken after the test and those taken before the test. Relative adrenal insufficiency (ie, nonresponders) was defined by a response of 9 µg/dL or less.7,8

Follow-up
The following data were recorded daily during the 28-day period following randomization: vital signs, results from standard laboratory tests and cultures of specimen drawn from any new site of infection, and interventions. In addition, the patient's status at discharge from ICU and hospital and 1 year after randomization was recorded.

End Points
The main end point was the 28-day survival distribution from randomization in nonresponders to the short corticotropin test. Secondary end points were 28-day survival distributions from randomization in responders to the short corticotropin test and in all patients; 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates; and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal during the 28 days from randomization in the 2 subsets of patients and in all patients.

Adverse events were carefully monitored and classified as being possibly related to corticosteroids (superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric disorders), possibly related to vasopressors (life-threatening arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, limb or cerebral ischemia), related to ICU invasive procedures, and not related to 1 of the 3 previous categories.

Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
A total of 270 patients was the calculated sample size needed to detect, in a 1-sided test performed with a 0.05 type I error, a difference between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate of 20% with a 90% probability, assuming a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup7,22 and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock.7 A 1-sided formulation was chosen to compute the sample size because the trial was designed to test whether low doses of corticosteroids were more effective than placebo, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating the opposite alternative hypothesis (a deleterious effect of corticosteroids).22,23

The 2 interim analyses were planned using an O'Brien and Fleming stopping boundary.24 With this procedure, the differences between the 2 groups were considered significant if the critical z values were higher than 3.471, 2.454, and 2.004 at the first, second, and final analyses, respectively (corresponding to nominal 2-sided P values <.0005, <.0141 and <.0451, respectively).

The statistical analysis, prospectively defined, was performed according to the intent-to-treat principle (in all analyses, patients were grouped according to their original randomized treatment) with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For continuous variables, the mean (SDs) are reported whereas, for categorical variables, the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages are given.

Analyses were similarly performed in nonresponders, in responders, and in all patients. Pretreatment characteristics were compared between groups using the t test (for continuous variables) or χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate (for categorical variables). Cumulative event curves (28-day survival and time-to-vasopressor therapy withdrawal end points) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier procedure and median times to event were reported. The effects of treatments on these end points were estimated from adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models25 using baseline cortisol, cortisol response, McCabe classification, LOD score, arterial lactate levels, and PaO2/FIO2 results for the adjustment.8 Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Proportionality among the event rates in the Cox models was assessed by the plot of the log (−log [survival function]) vs time. When the proportionality assumption was not upheld, Cox models were not used and only the Kaplan-Meier curves were reported along with log-rank tests. For 28-day survival, patients who were still alive at 28 days were treated as censored. For this end point, the number needed to treat at 28 days was estimated.26 For time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal, among patients who had more than 1 outcome event during the 28 days from randomization, time to the first event was used in the analyses. For this end point, the patients who died before vasopressor therapy could be withdrawn and those for whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn during the 28 days from randomization were treated as censored. The effects of treatments on the frequency of fatal events (28-day, ICU, hospital and 1-year mortality rates) were estimated from logistic regression analysis using the same variables for the adjustment as the Cox models. Corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% CIs were reported. We also computed the 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year relative risks (RRs) of death along with their 95% CIs. The frequency of adverse events was compared between groups using the χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided.

Results
Study Description
From October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999, 1326 patients were screened and 300 patients (placebo, 149; corticosteroids, 151) were included in the study (Figure 1). Interim analyses were performed on April 3, 1997, and April 20, 1998, after the evaluation of 114 and 220 patients, respectively. After each analysis, the independent main end point and safety monitoring board advised the study chairpersons to continue the study. We included the patient in the placebo group who died before study drugs could be administered in our intent-to-treat analysis. One patient in the corticosteroid group was excluded from the final analysis because of consent withdrawal. Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).

Characteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion
At baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2). Cortisol response to corticotropin was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group in the all-patients analysis, but the distribution of patients according to our 3-level prognostic classification8 was similar in the 2 groups. The type and site of infection and the type of organism involved were also similar in the 2 groups (Table 3). Finally, a blinded evaluation determined that appropriate antibiotic therapy, based on the site of infection and available cultures, was promptly (<24 hours from diagnosis of severe sepsis) started and continued for at least 7 days in most cases (ie, 95% in the placebo group, 91% in the corticosteroid group).

Mortality Distribution
Nonresponders
At day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 12 days in the placebo group and 24 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02; Figure 2A). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 7 (95% CI, 4-49).

Responders
At day 28, there were 18 deaths (53%) in the placebo group and 22 deaths (61%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 14 days in the placebo group and 16.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of survival distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .81) (Figure 2B).

All Patients
At day 28, there were 91 deaths (61%) in the placebo group and 82 deaths (55%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 13 days in the placebo group and 19.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .03) (Figure 2C). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 8 (95% CI, 5-81).

Mortality Rates
Nonresponders
As mentioned above, at day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = .04). There were 81 deaths (70%) in the placebo group and 66 deaths (58%) in the corticosteroid group at the end of ICU stay (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00; adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89; P = .02). A similar significant difference was observed at the end of hospital stay. There were 88 deaths (77%) in the placebo group and 77 deaths (68%) in the corticosteroid group after 1 year of follow-up (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.04; P = .07) (Table 4).

Responders
There was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in responders (Table 4).

All Patients
There was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in all patients. For example, the ICU mortality is represented by RR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.75-1.05), adjusted OR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02), P = .06 and year of follow-up is represented by RR, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.78-1.04), adjusted OR, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.36-1.05), P = .08 (Table 4).

Time-to-Vasopressor-Therapy Withdrawal
Nonresponders
The median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 10 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.29-2.84; P = .001) (Figure 3A). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.

Responders
The median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group and 9 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .49, Figure 3B). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 18 patients (53%) in the placebo group and in 18 patients (50%) in the corticosteroid group.

All Patients
The median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 9 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.10-2.16; P = .01; Figure 3C). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 64 patients (43%) in the placebo group and in 83 patients (55%) in the corticosteroid group.

Adverse Events
There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of adverse events possibly related to corticosteroids or vasopressors, or related to ICU invasive procedures (Table 5).

Comment
We found that a 7-day replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50 µg tablet once daily) significantly reduced 28-day mortality and duration of vasopressor administration in all patients with septic shock, in particular those with relative adrenal insufficiency. In addition, among the latter, corticosteroid therapy significantly reduced mortality during both ICU and hospital stays, and tended to reduce 1-year mortality. Our results indicate that, in this population, 1 additional life could be saved at day 28 for every 7 patients treated with corticosteroids. Replacement therapy had no significant effect on the same variables in patients who had septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency. If the power to detect differences in responders was lower than that in nonresponders due to the lower proportion of responders, it should be observed that no tendency toward efficacy (or deleterious effect) was observed in responders for any of the above mentioned variables. These results confirm the hypothesis on which the study was planned that patients with septic shock with relative adrenal insufficiency could benefit from replacement therapy.

Our results are consistent with a study of healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin27 and with 2 studies of patients with septic shock,12,13 that showed that low doses of hydrocortisone can restore vascular responsiveness to catecholamines. Our results are also consistent with those of 2 small trials showing that replacement therapy with hydrocortisone reduces the time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Finally, our study establishes that a short corticotropin test performed at early onset of septic shock is useful for identifying patients that could most benefit from replacement therapy with corticosteroids. However, it has to be stressed that the time required to obtain the results largely depends on the method used to measure cortisol (eg, enzymatic method, radioimmunoassay) and therefore that treatment should be started as soon as the test has been completed.

The sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 20% between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate using a 1-sided formulation. Such a formulation was chosen because the preliminary reports that were available at the planning phase of the study22,23 had shown that for several days patients tolerated well 200 to 300 mg of hydrocortisone daily, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating a hypothetical deleterious effect of corticosteroids. However, as recommended by the 9th International Conference on Harmonization, at the time of analysis, all tests were performed using a 2-sided formulation and all reported P values were 2-sided. The sample size was also computed based on the assumptions of a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock. In fact, the mortality rate in the nonresponder placebo subgroup (63%) was much lower than expected compared with the reports that were available at the planning phase of the study7,22 and with the hypothesis that patients with adrenal insufficiency would very likely die without hormone replacement. Conversely, the proportion of nonresponders (77%) was much higher than expected and the resulting increase in the sample size of nonresponders (from 108 to 229) may have favored the detection of a lower difference (10%) than expected between the 2 groups.

Several differences between the design of this positive study and previous negative studies28-33 deserve comment. First, our trial was focused on a very specific population who were presumed to benefit from corticosteroids because of relative adrenal insufficiency. Second, low doses of a combination of the natural hormone hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used (as recommended to treat adrenal insufficiency)16 rather than high doses of a synthetic glucocorticoid compound. The addition of fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone was justified because primary adrenal insufficiency could not be ruled out16 since it has been shown that 40% to 65% of critically ill patients have high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations.34,35 Moreover, in situations that require high amounts of active glucocorticoid, the reduction of fludrocortisone to cortisol can serve as a second source of cortisol in addition to that of adrenal glands.36 Third, patients were treated for a longer time (ie, 7 days) than those treated in previous trials. Indeed, recent work in healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin37 and in patients with septic shock23,38 have shown that short courses of corticosteroid treatment may be followed by a rebound of the systemic inflammatory response.

In conclusion, in catecholamine-dependent septic shock patients, particularly those with relative adrenal insufficiency, a 7-day treatment with the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone is safe and associated with a significant reduction in short-term and long-term mortality. In practice, we suggest that all patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock should be given the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as soon as a short corticotropin stimulation test is performed. When the results of the test are available, treatment may be withdrawn in responders and continued up to 7 days in nonresponders. Further studies are required to better determine the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroids to be given in this setting. The interest of a replacement therapy with corticosteroids in patients with septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency deserves additional investigation.",0.75922686,"Yes, corticosteroids do reduce 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency. In the study, among patients identified as nonresponders to the corticotropin stimulation test (those with relative adrenal insufficiency), the 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the group receiving corticosteroids compared to the placebo group. Specifically, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group, leading to a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.95; P = .02), indicating a statistically significant reduction in mortality with corticosteroid treatment. Additionally, the study concluded that treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death without increasing adverse events.",0.7

Corticosteroids were the first anti-inflammatory drugs tested in randomized trials.

Methods
Experimental Design and Study Organization
This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed on 2 parallel groups at 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in France (Figure 1). It was supported by Groupe d'Etude et de Recherche sur le Médicament (GERMED), which awarded a grant from publicly funded resources. The protocol was approved by the Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale of Saint-Germain en Laye, France, on February 9, 1995. Inclusions were authorized from September 11, 1995. Two interim analyses were planned. An independent main end point and safety monitoring board met after each interim analysis to decide whether the study should be continued or stopped. Enrollment ended March 15, 1999. At the end of the study, an independent diagnosis validation committee blindly classified each patient as being unquestionable, probable, or nonprobable for having had septic shock.

Patients
All patients 18 years or older and hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all the following criteria: (1) documented site (or at least strong suspicion) of infection, as evidenced by one or more of the following: presence of polymorphs in a normally sterile body fluid (except blood), positive culture or Gram stain of a normally sterile body fluid, clinical focus of infection (eg, fecal peritonitis), wound with purulent discharge, pneumonia or other clinical evidence of systemic infection (eg, purpura fulminans); (2) temperature higher than 38.3°C or lower than 35.6°C; (3) heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute; (4) systolic arterial pressure lower than 90 mm Hg for at least 1 hour despite adequate fluid replacement and more than 5 µg/kg of body weight of dopamine or current treatment with epinephrine or norepinephrine; (5) urinary output of less than 0.5 mL/kg of body weight for at least 1 hour or ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) of less than 280 mm Hg; (6) arterial lactate levels higher than 2 mmol/L; and (7) need for mechanical ventilation. Written informed consent had to be obtained from the patients themselves or their relatives and a short corticotropin test had to be performed before randomization. Finally, patients had to be randomized within 3 hours of the onset of shock.

Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or had evidence for acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, advanced form of cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection, and contraindication or formal indication for corticosteroids.

During recruitment, we refined the eligibility criteria by not making the arterial lactate requirement mandatory (the 6th criterion) but adding it as an option to the 5th criterion. We also increased the maximum delay from the onset of septic shock and randomization from 3 to 8 hours (amendment of July 18, 1996); and we excluded patients who received etomidate during the 6 hours preceding randomization because it is a selective inhibitor of the 11 β-hydroxylase and therefore could interfere with cortisol response to corticotropin (amendment of June 19, 1997).

Randomization
Randomization was centrally performed, concealed, and stratified by center in blocks of 4 according to a computer-generated random number table. In each center, sequentially numbered boxes containing the whole treatment for each patient were delivered to the investigator by the pharmacist following the order of the randomization list. All patients, medical and nursing staffs, and pharmacists remained blinded throughout the study period.

Hydrocortisone came in vials containing 100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules containing 2 mL of glucose solution solvent, which was administered intravenously every 6 hours as a 50-mg bolus (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France). One tablet containing 50 µg of 9-α-fludrocortisone was administered daily through a nasogastric tube with 10 to 40 mL of water over 30 seconds (Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux, Paris, France). Placebos were indiscernible from active treatments. Treatment duration was 7 days.

Data Collection at Inclusion
Clinical Evaluation
The following data were recorded: (1) general characteristics including estimated prognosis of any underlying disease17 and level of activity limitation18; (2) severity of illness assessed by vital signs, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II),19 and Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score20; and (3) interventions including the volume of fluid infusion and the type and doses of vasopressors and antibiotics.

Laboratory Variables
Hematological and chemistry data, arterial lactate and blood gas determinations, and blood cultures and cultures of specimen drawn from the site of infection were done systematically. The short corticotropin test was performed using a 250-µg intravenous bolus of tetracosactrin (Synacthène Ciba, Rueil-Malmaison, France). Blood samples were taken immediately before the test and 30 and 60 minutes after the test. After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at −80°C until assayed. Cortisol was measured blindly and serially before interim and final statistical analyses using Immunotech radioimmunoassay.21 To reduce heterogeneity in cortisol determination, all plasma samples were measured at a central laboratory. Cortisol response was defined as the difference between the highest of the concentrations taken after the test and those taken before the test. Relative adrenal insufficiency (ie, nonresponders) was defined by a response of 9 µg/dL or less.7,8

Follow-up
The following data were recorded daily during the 28-day period following randomization: vital signs, results from standard laboratory tests and cultures of specimen drawn from any new site of infection, and interventions. In addition, the patient's status at discharge from ICU and hospital and 1 year after randomization was recorded.

End Points
The main end point was the 28-day survival distribution from randomization in nonresponders to the short corticotropin test. Secondary end points were 28-day survival distributions from randomization in responders to the short corticotropin test and in all patients; 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates; and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal during the 28 days from randomization in the 2 subsets of patients and in all patients.

Adverse events were carefully monitored and classified as being possibly related to corticosteroids (superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric disorders), possibly related to vasopressors (life-threatening arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, limb or cerebral ischemia), related to ICU invasive procedures, and not related to 1 of the 3 previous categories.

Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
A total of 270 patients was the calculated sample size needed to detect, in a 1-sided test performed with a 0.05 type I error, a difference between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate of 20% with a 90% probability, assuming a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup7,22 and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock.7 A 1-sided formulation was chosen to compute the sample size because the trial was designed to test whether low doses of corticosteroids were more effective than placebo, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating the opposite alternative hypothesis (a deleterious effect of corticosteroids).22,23

The 2 interim analyses were planned using an O'Brien and Fleming stopping boundary.24 With this procedure, the differences between the 2 groups were considered significant if the critical z values were higher than 3.471, 2.454, and 2.004 at the first, second, and final analyses, respectively (corresponding to nominal 2-sided P values <.0005, <.0141 and <.0451, respectively).

The statistical analysis, prospectively defined, was performed according to the intent-to-treat principle (in all analyses, patients were grouped according to their original randomized treatment) with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For continuous variables, the mean (SDs) are reported whereas, for categorical variables, the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages are given.

Analyses were similarly performed in nonresponders, in responders, and in all patients. Pretreatment characteristics were compared between groups using the t test (for continuous variables) or χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate (for categorical variables). Cumulative event curves (28-day survival and time-to-vasopressor therapy withdrawal end points) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier procedure and median times to event were reported. The effects of treatments on these end points were estimated from adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models25 using baseline cortisol, cortisol response, McCabe classification, LOD score, arterial lactate levels, and PaO2/FIO2 results for the adjustment.8 Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Proportionality among the event rates in the Cox models was assessed by the plot of the log (−log [survival function]) vs time. When the proportionality assumption was not upheld, Cox models were not used and only the Kaplan-Meier curves were reported along with log-rank tests. For 28-day survival, patients who were still alive at 28 days were treated as censored. For this end point, the number needed to treat at 28 days was estimated.26 For time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal, among patients who had more than 1 outcome event during the 28 days from randomization, time to the first event was used in the analyses. For this end point, the patients who died before vasopressor therapy could be withdrawn and those for whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn during the 28 days from randomization were treated as censored. The effects of treatments on the frequency of fatal events (28-day, ICU, hospital and 1-year mortality rates) were estimated from logistic regression analysis using the same variables for the adjustment as the Cox models. Corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% CIs were reported. We also computed the 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year relative risks (RRs) of death along with their 95% CIs. The frequency of adverse events was compared between groups using the χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided.

Results
Study Description
From October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999, 1326 patients were screened and 300 patients (placebo, 149; corticosteroids, 151) were included in the study (Figure 1). Interim analyses were performed on April 3, 1997, and April 20, 1998, after the evaluation of 114 and 220 patients, respectively. After each analysis, the independent main end point and safety monitoring board advised the study chairpersons to continue the study. We included the patient in the placebo group who died before study drugs could be administered in our intent-to-treat analysis. One patient in the corticosteroid group was excluded from the final analysis because of consent withdrawal. Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).

Characteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion
At baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2). Cortisol response to corticotropin was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group in the all-patients analysis, but the distribution of patients according to our 3-level prognostic classification8 was similar in the 2 groups. The type and site of infection and the type of organism involved were also similar in the 2 groups (Table 3). Finally, a blinded evaluation determined that appropriate antibiotic therapy, based on the site of infection and available cultures, was promptly (<24 hours from diagnosis of severe sepsis) started and continued for at least 7 days in most cases (ie, 95% in the placebo group, 91% in the corticosteroid group).

Mortality Distribution
Nonresponders
At day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 12 days in the placebo group and 24 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02; Figure 2A). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 7 (95% CI, 4-49).

Responders
At day 28, there were 18 deaths (53%) in the placebo group and 22 deaths (61%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 14 days in the placebo group and 16.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of survival distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .81) (Figure 2B).

All Patients
At day 28, there were 91 deaths (61%) in the placebo group and 82 deaths (55%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 13 days in the placebo group and 19.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .03) (Figure 2C). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 8 (95% CI, 5-81).

Mortality Rates
Nonresponders
As mentioned above, at day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = .04). There were 81 deaths (70%) in the placebo group and 66 deaths (58%) in the corticosteroid group at the end of ICU stay (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00; adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89; P = .02). A similar significant difference was observed at the end of hospital stay. There were 88 deaths (77%) in the placebo group and 77 deaths (68%) in the corticosteroid group after 1 year of follow-up (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.04; P = .07) (Table 4).

Responders
There was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in responders (Table 4).

All Patients
There was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in all patients. For example, the ICU mortality is represented by RR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.75-1.05), adjusted OR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02), P = .06 and year of follow-up is represented by RR, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.78-1.04), adjusted OR, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.36-1.05), P = .08 (Table 4).

Time-to-Vasopressor-Therapy Withdrawal
Nonresponders
The median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 10 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.29-2.84; P = .001) (Figure 3A). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.

Responders
The median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group and 9 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .49, Figure 3B). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 18 patients (53%) in the placebo group and in 18 patients (50%) in the corticosteroid group.

All Patients
The median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 9 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.10-2.16; P = .01; Figure 3C). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 64 patients (43%) in the placebo group and in 83 patients (55%) in the corticosteroid group.

Adverse Events
There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of adverse events possibly related to corticosteroids or vasopressors, or related to ICU invasive procedures (Table 5).

Comment
We found that a 7-day replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50 µg tablet once daily) significantly reduced 28-day mortality and duration of vasopressor administration in all patients with septic shock, in particular those with relative adrenal insufficiency. In addition, among the latter, corticosteroid therapy significantly reduced mortality during both ICU and hospital stays, and tended to reduce 1-year mortality. Our results indicate that, in this population, 1 additional life could be saved at day 28 for every 7 patients treated with corticosteroids. Replacement therapy had no significant effect on the same variables in patients who had septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency. If the power to detect differences in responders was lower than that in nonresponders due to the lower proportion of responders, it should be observed that no tendency toward efficacy (or deleterious effect) was observed in responders for any of the above mentioned variables. These results confirm the hypothesis on which the study was planned that patients with septic shock with relative adrenal insufficiency could benefit from replacement therapy.

Our results are consistent with a study of healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin27 and with 2 studies of patients with septic shock,12,13 that showed that low doses of hydrocortisone can restore vascular responsiveness to catecholamines. Our results are also consistent with those of 2 small trials showing that replacement therapy with hydrocortisone reduces the time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Finally, our study establishes that a short corticotropin test performed at early onset of septic shock is useful for identifying patients that could most benefit from replacement therapy with corticosteroids. However, it has to be stressed that the time required to obtain the results largely depends on the method used to measure cortisol (eg, enzymatic method, radioimmunoassay) and therefore that treatment should be started as soon as the test has been completed.

The sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 20% between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate using a 1-sided formulation. Such a formulation was chosen because the preliminary reports that were available at the planning phase of the study22,23 had shown that for several days patients tolerated well 200 to 300 mg of hydrocortisone daily, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating a hypothetical deleterious effect of corticosteroids. However, as recommended by the 9th International Conference on Harmonization, at the time of analysis, all tests were performed using a 2-sided formulation and all reported P values were 2-sided. The sample size was also computed based on the assumptions of a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock. In fact, the mortality rate in the nonresponder placebo subgroup (63%) was much lower than expected compared with the reports that were available at the planning phase of the study7,22 and with the hypothesis that patients with adrenal insufficiency would very likely die without hormone replacement. Conversely, the proportion of nonresponders (77%) was much higher than expected and the resulting increase in the sample size of nonresponders (from 108 to 229) may have favored the detection of a lower difference (10%) than expected between the 2 groups.

Several differences between the design of this positive study and previous negative studies28-33 deserve comment. First, our trial was focused on a very specific population who were presumed to benefit from corticosteroids because of relative adrenal insufficiency. Second, low doses of a combination of the natural hormone hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used (as recommended to treat adrenal insufficiency)16 rather than high doses of a synthetic glucocorticoid compound. The addition of fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone was justified because primary adrenal insufficiency could not be ruled out16 since it has been shown that 40% to 65% of critically ill patients have high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations.34,35 Moreover, in situations that require high amounts of active glucocorticoid, the reduction of fludrocortisone to cortisol can serve as a second source of cortisol in addition to that of adrenal glands.36 Third, patients were treated for a longer time (ie, 7 days) than those treated in previous trials. Indeed, recent work in healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin37 and in patients with septic shock23,38 have shown that short courses of corticosteroid treatment may be followed by a rebound of the systemic inflammatory response.

In conclusion, in catecholamine-dependent septic shock patients, particularly those with relative adrenal insufficiency, a 7-day treatment with the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone is safe and associated with a significant reduction in short-term and long-term mortality. In practice, we suggest that all patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock should be given the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as soon as a short corticotropin stimulation test is performed. When the results of the test are available, treatment may be withdrawn in responders and continued up to 7 days in nonresponders. Further studies are required to better determine the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroids to be given in this setting. The interest of a replacement therapy with corticosteroids in patients with septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency deserves additional investigation.",0.75922686,"Yes, corticosteroids do reduce 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency. In a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind trial cited in the abstract, patients classified as nonresponders (those with relative adrenal insufficiency) showed a significant reduction in 28-day mortality when treated with corticosteroids. Specifically, 63% of patients in the placebo group died within 28 days compared to 53% in the corticosteroid group, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02). This indicates that the corticosteroid treatment was effective in reducing the risk of death within the 28-day period for these patients.",0.5

Context Septic shock may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency. Thus, a replacement therapy of low doses of corticosteroids has been proposed to treat septic shock.

Objective To assess whether low doses of corticosteroids improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency.

Design and Setting Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial performed in 19 intensive care units in France from October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999.

Patients Three hundred adult patients who fulfilled usual criteria for septic shock were enrolled after undergoing a short corticotropin test.

Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone (50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50-µg tablet once daily) (n = 151) or matching placebos (n = 149) for 7 days.

Main Outcome Measure Twenty-eight-day survival distribution in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (nonresponders to the corticotropin test).

Results One patient from the corticosteroid group was excluded from analyses because of consent withdrawal. There were 229 nonresponders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36). In nonresponders, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.95; P = .02). Vasopressor therapy was withdrawn within 28 days in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.84; P = .001). There was no significant difference between groups in responders. Adverse events rates were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion In our trial, a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events.

Severe sepsis remains an important cause of death, accounting for 9.3% of all deaths in the United States in 1995.1 If our understanding of the mechanisms of host response to stress has strongly progressed during the last 2 decades,2 the various drugs developed for specific targets of the cytokine cascade have failed to improve patient survival.3,4

Corticosteroids were the first anti-inflammatory drugs tested in randomized trials. At high doses during short courses, they did not induce favorable effects.5,6 However, the observation that severe sepsis may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency7,8 or systemic inflammation-induced glucocorticoid receptor resistance9 prompted renewed interest of a replacement therapy with low doses of corticosteroids during longer periods.10,11

The interest of this new approach was confirmed by the demonstration that a single intravenous administration of 50 mg of hydrocortisone strongly improved norepinephrine and phenylephrine mean arterial pressure dose-response relationships in patients with septic shock,12,13 particularly in those with relative adrenal insufficiency.12 Moreover, 2 small placebo-controlled randomized trials also showed that prolonged treatment (≥5 days) with low doses of hydrocortisone (about 300 mg daily) significantly improved the time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Thus, we designed this placebo-controlled study to assess whether a replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (assuming the possibility of a primary adrenal insufficiency)16 could improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock, with particular interest in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency.

Methods
Experimental Design and Study Organization
This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed on 2 parallel groups at 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in France (Figure 1). It was supported by Groupe d'Etude et de Recherche sur le Médicament (GERMED), which awarded a grant from publicly funded resources. The protocol was approved by the Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale of Saint-Germain en Laye, France, on February 9, 1995. Inclusions were authorized from September 11, 1995. Two interim analyses were planned. An independent main end point and safety monitoring board met after each interim analysis to decide whether the study should be continued or stopped. Enrollment ended March 15, 1999. At the end of the study, an independent diagnosis validation committee blindly classified each patient as being unquestionable, probable, or nonprobable for having had septic shock.

Patients
All patients 18 years or older and hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all the following criteria: (1) documented site (or at least strong suspicion) of infection, as evidenced by one or more of the following: presence of polymorphs in a normally sterile body fluid (except blood), positive culture or Gram stain of a normally sterile body fluid, clinical focus of infection (eg, fecal peritonitis), wound with purulent discharge, pneumonia or other clinical evidence of systemic infection (eg, purpura fulminans); (2) temperature higher than 38.3°C or lower than 35.6°C; (3) heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute; (4) systolic arterial pressure lower than 90 mm Hg for at least 1 hour despite adequate fluid replacement and more than 5 µg/kg of body weight of dopamine or current treatment with epinephrine or norepinephrine; (5) urinary output of less than 0.5 mL/kg of body weight for at least 1 hour or ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) of less than 280 mm Hg; (6) arterial lactate levels higher than 2 mmol/L; and (7) need for mechanical ventilation. Written informed consent had to be obtained from the patients themselves or their relatives and a short corticotropin test had to be performed before randomization. Finally, patients had to be randomized within 3 hours of the onset of shock.

Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or had evidence for acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, advanced form of cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection, and contraindication or formal indication for corticosteroids.

During recruitment, we refined the eligibility criteria by not making the arterial lactate requirement mandatory (the 6th criterion) but adding it as an option to the 5th criterion. We also increased the maximum delay from the onset of septic shock and randomization from 3 to 8 hours (amendment of July 18, 1996); and we excluded patients who received etomidate during the 6 hours preceding randomization because it is a selective inhibitor of the 11 β-hydroxylase and therefore could interfere with cortisol response to corticotropin (amendment of June 19, 1997).

Randomization
Randomization was centrally performed, concealed, and stratified by center in blocks of 4 according to a computer-generated random number table. In each center, sequentially numbered boxes containing the whole treatment for each patient were delivered to the investigator by the pharmacist following the order of the randomization list. All patients, medical and nursing staffs, and pharmacists remained blinded throughout the study period.

Treatments
Hydrocortisone came in vials containing 100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules containing 2 mL of glucose solution solvent, which was administered intravenously every 6 hours as a 50-mg bolus (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France). One tablet containing 50 µg of 9-α-fludrocortisone was administered daily through a nasogastric tube with 10 to 40 mL of water over 30 seconds (Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux, Paris, France). Placebos were indiscernible from active treatments. Treatment duration was 7 days.

Data Collection at Inclusion
Clinical Evaluation
The following data were recorded: (1) general characteristics including estimated prognosis of any underlying disease17 and level of activity limitation18; (2) severity of illness assessed by vital signs, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II),19 and Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score20; and (3) interventions including the volume of fluid infusion and the type and doses of vasopressors and antibiotics.

Laboratory Variables
Hematological and chemistry data, arterial lactate and blood gas determinations, and blood cultures and cultures of specimen drawn from the site of infection were done systematically. The short corticotropin test was performed using a 250-µg intravenous bolus of tetracosactrin (Synacthène Ciba, Rueil-Malmaison, France). Blood samples were taken immediately before the test and 30 and 60 minutes after the test. After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at −80°C until assayed. Cortisol was measured blindly and serially before interim and final statistical analyses using Immunotech radioimmunoassay.21 To reduce heterogeneity in cortisol determination, all plasma samples were measured at a central laboratory. Cortisol response was defined as the difference between the highest of the concentrations taken after the test and those taken before the test. Relative adrenal insufficiency (ie, nonresponders) was defined by a response of 9 µg/dL or less.7,8

Follow-up
The following data were recorded daily during the 28-day period following randomization: vital signs, results from standard laboratory tests and cultures of specimen drawn from any new site of infection, and interventions. In addition, the patient's status at discharge from ICU and hospital and 1 year after randomization was recorded.

End Points
The main end point was the 28-day survival distribution from randomization in nonresponders to the short corticotropin test. Secondary end points were 28-day survival distributions from randomization in responders to the short corticotropin test and in all patients; 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates; and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal during the 28 days from randomization in the 2 subsets of patients and in all patients.

Adverse events were carefully monitored and classified as being possibly related to corticosteroids (superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric disorders), possibly related to vasopressors (life-threatening arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, limb or cerebral ischemia), related to ICU invasive procedures, and not related to 1 of the 3 previous categories.

Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
A total of 270 patients was the calculated sample size needed to detect, in a 1-sided test performed with a 0.05 type I error, a difference between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate of 20% with a 90% probability, assuming a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup7,22 and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock.7 A 1-sided formulation was chosen to compute the sample size because the trial was designed to test whether low doses of corticosteroids were more effective than placebo, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating the opposite alternative hypothesis (a deleterious effect of corticosteroids).22,23

The 2 interim analyses were planned using an O'Brien and Fleming stopping boundary.24 With this procedure, the differences between the 2 groups were considered significant if the critical z values were higher than 3.471, 2.454, and 2.004 at the first, second, and final analyses, respectively (corresponding to nominal 2-sided P values <.0005, <.0141 and <.0451, respectively).

The statistical analysis, prospectively defined, was performed according to the intent-to-treat principle (in all analyses, patients were grouped according to their original randomized treatment) with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For continuous variables, the mean (SDs) are reported whereas, for categorical variables, the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages are given.

Analyses were similarly performed in nonresponders, in responders, and in all patients. Pretreatment characteristics were compared between groups using the t test (for continuous variables) or χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate (for categorical variables). Cumulative event curves (28-day survival and time-to-vasopressor therapy withdrawal end points) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier procedure and median times to event were reported. The effects of treatments on these end points were estimated from adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models25 using baseline cortisol, cortisol response, McCabe classification, LOD score, arterial lactate levels, and PaO2/FIO2 results for the adjustment.8 Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Proportionality among the event rates in the Cox models was assessed by the plot of the log (−log [survival function]) vs time. When the proportionality assumption was not upheld, Cox models were not used and only the Kaplan-Meier curves were reported along with log-rank tests. For 28-day survival, patients who were still alive at 28 days were treated as censored. For this end point, the number needed to treat at 28 days was estimated.26 For time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal, among patients who had more than 1 outcome event during the 28 days from randomization, time to the first event was used in the analyses. For this end point, the patients who died before vasopressor therapy could be withdrawn and those for whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn during the 28 days from randomization were treated as censored. The effects of treatments on the frequency of fatal events (28-day, ICU, hospital and 1-year mortality rates) were estimated from logistic regression analysis using the same variables for the adjustment as the Cox models. Corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% CIs were reported. We also computed the 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year relative risks (RRs) of death along with their 95% CIs. The frequency of adverse events was compared between groups using the χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided.

Study Description
From October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999, 1326 patients were screened and 300 patients (placebo, 149; corticosteroids, 151) were included in the study (Figure 1). Interim analyses were performed on April 3, 1997, and April 20, 1998, after the evaluation of 114 and 220 patients, respectively. After each analysis, the independent main end point and safety monitoring board advised the study chairpersons to continue the study. We included the patient in the placebo group who died before study drugs could be administered in our intent-to-treat analysis. One patient in the corticosteroid group was excluded from the final analysis because of consent withdrawal. Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).

Characteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion
At baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2). Cortisol response to corticotropin was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group in the all-patients analysis, but the distribution of patients according to our 3-level prognostic classification8 was similar in the 2 groups. The type and site of infection and the type of organism involved were also similar in the 2 groups (Table 3). Finally, a blinded evaluation determined that appropriate antibiotic therapy, based on the site of infection and available cultures, was promptly (<24 hours from diagnosis of severe sepsis) started and continued for at least 7 days in most cases (ie, 95% in the placebo group, 91% in the corticosteroid group).

Mortality Distribution
Nonresponders
At day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 12 days in the placebo group and 24 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02; Figure 2A). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 7 (95% CI, 4-49).

Responders
At day 28, there were 18 deaths (53%) in the placebo group and 22 deaths (61%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 14 days in the placebo group and 16.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of survival distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .81) (Figure 2B).

All Patients
At day 28, there were 91 deaths (61%) in the placebo group and 82 deaths (55%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 13 days in the placebo group and 19.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .03) (Figure 2C). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 8 (95% CI, 5-81).

Mortality Rates
Nonresponders
As mentioned above, at day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = .04). There were 81 deaths (70%) in the placebo group and 66 deaths (58%) in the corticosteroid group at the end of ICU stay (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00; adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89; P = .02). A similar significant difference was observed at the end of hospital stay. There were 88 deaths (77%) in the placebo group and 77 deaths (68%) in the corticosteroid group after 1 year of follow-up (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.04; P = .07) (Table 4).

Responders
There was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in responders (Table 4).

All Patients
There was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in all patients. For example, the ICU mortality is represented by RR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.75-1.05), adjusted OR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02), P = .06 and year of follow-up is represented by RR, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.78-1.04), adjusted OR, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.36-1.05), P = .08 (Table 4).

Time-to-Vasopressor-Therapy Withdrawal
Nonresponders
The median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 10 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.29-2.84; P = .001) (Figure 3A). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.

Responders
The median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group and 9 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .49, Figure 3B). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 18 patients (53%) in the placebo group and in 18 patients (50%) in the corticosteroid group.

All Patients
The median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 9 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.10-2.16; P = .01; Figure 3C). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 64 patients (43%) in the placebo group and in 83 patients (55%) in the corticosteroid group.

Adverse Events
There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of adverse events possibly related to corticosteroids or vasopressors, or related to ICU invasive procedures (Table 5).

Comment
We found that a 7-day replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50 µg tablet once daily) significantly reduced 28-day mortality and duration of vasopressor administration in all patients with septic shock, in particular those with relative adrenal insufficiency. In addition, among the latter, corticosteroid therapy significantly reduced mortality during both ICU and hospital stays, and tended to reduce 1-year mortality. Our results indicate that, in this population, 1 additional life could be saved at day 28 for every 7 patients treated with corticosteroids. Replacement therapy had no significant effect on the same variables in patients who had septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency. If the power to detect differences in responders was lower than that in nonresponders due to the lower proportion of responders, it should be observed that no tendency toward efficacy (or deleterious effect) was observed in responders for any of the above mentioned variables. These results confirm the hypothesis on which the study was planned that patients with septic shock with relative adrenal insufficiency could benefit from replacement therapy.

Our results are consistent with a study of healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin27 and with 2 studies of patients with septic shock,12,13 that showed that low doses of hydrocortisone can restore vascular responsiveness to catecholamines. Our results are also consistent with those of 2 small trials showing that replacement therapy with hydrocortisone reduces the time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Finally, our study establishes that a short corticotropin test performed at early onset of septic shock is useful for identifying patients that could most benefit from replacement therapy with corticosteroids. However, it has to be stressed that the time required to obtain the results largely depends on the method used to measure cortisol (eg, enzymatic method, radioimmunoassay) and therefore that treatment should be started as soon as the test has been completed.

The sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 20% between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate using a 1-sided formulation. Such a formulation was chosen because the preliminary reports that were available at the planning phase of the study22,23 had shown that for several days patients tolerated well 200 to 300 mg of hydrocortisone daily, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating a hypothetical deleterious effect of corticosteroids. However, as recommended by the 9th International Conference on Harmonization, at the time of analysis, all tests were performed using a 2-sided formulation and all reported P values were 2-sided. The sample size was also computed based on the assumptions of a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock. In fact, the mortality rate in the nonresponder placebo subgroup (63%) was much lower than expected compared with the reports that were available at the planning phase of the study7,22 and with the hypothesis that patients with adrenal insufficiency would very likely die without hormone replacement. Conversely, the proportion of nonresponders (77%) was much higher than expected and the resulting increase in the sample size of nonresponders (from 108 to 229) may have favored the detection of a lower difference (10%) than expected between the 2 groups.

Several differences between the design of this positive study and previous negative studies28-33 deserve comment. First, our trial was focused on a very specific population who were presumed to benefit from corticosteroids because of relative adrenal insufficiency. Second, low doses of a combination of the natural hormone hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used (as recommended to treat adrenal insufficiency)16 rather than high doses of a synthetic glucocorticoid compound. The addition of fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone was justified because primary adrenal insufficiency could not be ruled out16 since it has been shown that 40% to 65% of critically ill patients have high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations.34,35 Moreover, in situations that require high amounts of active glucocorticoid, the reduction of fludrocortisone to cortisol can serve as a second source of cortisol in addition to that of adrenal glands.36 Third, patients were treated for a longer time (ie, 7 days) than those treated in previous trials. Indeed, recent work in healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin37 and in patients with septic shock23,38 have shown that short courses of corticosteroid treatment may be followed by a rebound of the systemic inflammatory response.

In conclusion, in catecholamine-dependent septic shock patients, particularly those with relative adrenal insufficiency, a 7-day treatment with the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone is safe and associated with a significant reduction in short-term and long-term mortality. In practice, we suggest that all patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock should be given the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as soon as a short corticotropin stimulation test is performed. When the results of the test are available, treatment may be withdrawn in responders and continued up to 7 days in nonresponders. Further studies are required to better determine the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroids to be given in this setting. The interest of a replacement therapy with corticosteroids in patients with septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency deserves additional investigation.",0.75922686,"Yes, corticosteroids do reduce 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency. The study found that among nonresponders to the corticotropin test (indicating relative adrenal insufficiency), the group receiving corticosteroids (hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone) had a significantly lower 28-day mortality rate (53%) compared to the placebo group (63%). The hazard ratio was 0.67, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.47 to 0.95, and a P-value of 0.02, indicating a statistically significant reduction in the risk of death in this group. Additionally, the study found that the treatment with corticosteroids allowed for earlier withdrawal from vasopressor therapy without increasing adverse events.",0.8

Context Septic shock may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency. Thus, a replacement therapy of low doses of corticosteroids has been proposed to treat septic shock.

Objective To assess whether low doses of corticosteroids improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency.

Design and Setting Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial performed in 19 intensive care units in France from October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999.

Patients Three hundred adult patients who fulfilled usual criteria for septic shock were enrolled after undergoing a short corticotropin test.

Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydrocortisone (50-mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50-µg tablet once daily) (n = 151) or matching placebos (n = 149) for 7 days.

Main Outcome Measure Twenty-eight-day survival distribution in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency (nonresponders to the corticotropin test).

Results One patient from the corticosteroid group was excluded from analyses because of consent withdrawal. There were 229 nonresponders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders to the corticotropin test (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36). In nonresponders, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.95; P = .02). Vasopressor therapy was withdrawn within 28 days in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-2.84; P = .001). There was no significant difference between groups in responders. Adverse events rates were similar in the 2 groups.

Conclusion In our trial, a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency without increasing adverse events.

Severe sepsis remains an important cause of death, accounting for 9.3% of all deaths in the United States in 1995.1 If our understanding of the mechanisms of host response to stress has strongly progressed during the last 2 decades,2 the various drugs developed for specific targets of the cytokine cascade have failed to improve patient survival.3,4

Corticosteroids were the first anti-inflammatory drugs tested in randomized trials. At high doses during short courses, they did not induce favorable effects.5,6 However, the observation that severe sepsis may be associated with relative adrenal insufficiency7,8 or systemic inflammation-induced glucocorticoid receptor resistance9 prompted renewed interest of a replacement therapy with low doses of corticosteroids during longer periods.10,11

The interest of this new approach was confirmed by the demonstration that a single intravenous administration of 50 mg of hydrocortisone strongly improved norepinephrine and phenylephrine mean arterial pressure dose-response relationships in patients with septic shock,12,13 particularly in those with relative adrenal insufficiency.12 Moreover, 2 small placebo-controlled randomized trials also showed that prolonged treatment (≥5 days) with low doses of hydrocortisone (about 300 mg daily) significantly improved the time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Thus, we designed this placebo-controlled study to assess whether a replacement therapy with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone (assuming the possibility of a primary adrenal insufficiency)16 could improve 28-day survival in patients with septic shock, with particular interest in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency.

Methods
Experimental Design and Study Organization
This placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study was performed on 2 parallel groups at 19 intensive care units (ICUs) in France (Figure 1). It was supported by Groupe d'Etude et de Recherche sur le Médicament (GERMED), which awarded a grant from publicly funded resources. The protocol was approved by the Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale of Saint-Germain en Laye, France, on February 9, 1995. Inclusions were authorized from September 11, 1995. Two interim analyses were planned. An independent main end point and safety monitoring board met after each interim analysis to decide whether the study should be continued or stopped. Enrollment ended March 15, 1999. At the end of the study, an independent diagnosis validation committee blindly classified each patient as being unquestionable, probable, or nonprobable for having had septic shock.

Patients
All patients 18 years or older and hospitalized in participating ICUs were prospectively enrolled in the study if they met all the following criteria: (1) documented site (or at least strong suspicion) of infection, as evidenced by one or more of the following: presence of polymorphs in a normally sterile body fluid (except blood), positive culture or Gram stain of a normally sterile body fluid, clinical focus of infection (eg, fecal peritonitis), wound with purulent discharge, pneumonia or other clinical evidence of systemic infection (eg, purpura fulminans); (2) temperature higher than 38.3°C or lower than 35.6°C; (3) heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute; (4) systolic arterial pressure lower than 90 mm Hg for at least 1 hour despite adequate fluid replacement and more than 5 µg/kg of body weight of dopamine or current treatment with epinephrine or norepinephrine; (5) urinary output of less than 0.5 mL/kg of body weight for at least 1 hour or ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FIO2) of less than 280 mm Hg; (6) arterial lactate levels higher than 2 mmol/L; and (7) need for mechanical ventilation. Written informed consent had to be obtained from the patients themselves or their relatives and a short corticotropin test had to be performed before randomization. Finally, patients had to be randomized within 3 hours of the onset of shock.

Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or had evidence for acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism, advanced form of cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection, and contraindication or formal indication for corticosteroids.

During recruitment, we refined the eligibility criteria by not making the arterial lactate requirement mandatory (the 6th criterion) but adding it as an option to the 5th criterion. We also increased the maximum delay from the onset of septic shock and randomization from 3 to 8 hours (amendment of July 18, 1996); and we excluded patients who received etomidate during the 6 hours preceding randomization because it is a selective inhibitor of the 11 β-hydroxylase and therefore could interfere with cortisol response to corticotropin (amendment of June 19, 1997).

Randomization
Randomization was centrally performed, concealed, and stratified by center in blocks of 4 according to a computer-generated random number table. In each center, sequentially numbered boxes containing the whole treatment for each patient were delivered to the investigator by the pharmacist following the order of the randomization list. All patients, medical and nursing staffs, and pharmacists remained blinded throughout the study period.

Treatments
Hydrocortisone came in vials containing 100 mg of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder and ampoules containing 2 mL of glucose solution solvent, which was administered intravenously every 6 hours as a 50-mg bolus (Roussel-Uclaf, Romainville, France). One tablet containing 50 µg of 9-α-fludrocortisone was administered daily through a nasogastric tube with 10 to 40 mL of water over 30 seconds (Pharmacie Centrale des Hôpitaux, Paris, France). Placebos were indiscernible from active treatments. Treatment duration was 7 days.

Data Collection at Inclusion
Clinical Evaluation
The following data were recorded: (1) general characteristics including estimated prognosis of any underlying disease17 and level of activity limitation18; (2) severity of illness assessed by vital signs, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II),19 and Logistic Organ Dysfunction (LOD) score20; and (3) interventions including the volume of fluid infusion and the type and doses of vasopressors and antibiotics.

Laboratory Variables
Hematological and chemistry data, arterial lactate and blood gas determinations, and blood cultures and cultures of specimen drawn from the site of infection were done systematically. The short corticotropin test was performed using a 250-µg intravenous bolus of tetracosactrin (Synacthène Ciba, Rueil-Malmaison, France). Blood samples were taken immediately before the test and 30 and 60 minutes after the test. After centrifugation, plasma samples were stored at −80°C until assayed. Cortisol was measured blindly and serially before interim and final statistical analyses using Immunotech radioimmunoassay.21 To reduce heterogeneity in cortisol determination, all plasma samples were measured at a central laboratory. Cortisol response was defined as the difference between the highest of the concentrations taken after the test and those taken before the test. Relative adrenal insufficiency (ie, nonresponders) was defined by a response of 9 µg/dL or less.7,8

Follow-up
The following data were recorded daily during the 28-day period following randomization: vital signs, results from standard laboratory tests and cultures of specimen drawn from any new site of infection, and interventions. In addition, the patient's status at discharge from ICU and hospital and 1 year after randomization was recorded.

End Points
The main end point was the 28-day survival distribution from randomization in nonresponders to the short corticotropin test. Secondary end points were 28-day survival distributions from randomization in responders to the short corticotropin test and in all patients; 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates; and time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal during the 28 days from randomization in the 2 subsets of patients and in all patients.

Adverse events were carefully monitored and classified as being possibly related to corticosteroids (superinfection, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychiatric disorders), possibly related to vasopressors (life-threatening arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, limb or cerebral ischemia), related to ICU invasive procedures, and not related to 1 of the 3 previous categories.

Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
A total of 270 patients was the calculated sample size needed to detect, in a 1-sided test performed with a 0.05 type I error, a difference between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate of 20% with a 90% probability, assuming a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup7,22 and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock.7 A 1-sided formulation was chosen to compute the sample size because the trial was designed to test whether low doses of corticosteroids were more effective than placebo, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating the opposite alternative hypothesis (a deleterious effect of corticosteroids).22,23

The 2 interim analyses were planned using an O'Brien and Fleming stopping boundary.24 With this procedure, the differences between the 2 groups were considered significant if the critical z values were higher than 3.471, 2.454, and 2.004 at the first, second, and final analyses, respectively (corresponding to nominal 2-sided P values <.0005, <.0141 and <.0451, respectively).

The statistical analysis, prospectively defined, was performed according to the intent-to-treat principle (in all analyses, patients were grouped according to their original randomized treatment) with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For continuous variables, the mean (SDs) are reported whereas, for categorical variables, the number of patients in each category and the corresponding percentages are given.

Analyses were similarly performed in nonresponders, in responders, and in all patients. Pretreatment characteristics were compared between groups using the t test (for continuous variables) or χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate (for categorical variables). Cumulative event curves (28-day survival and time-to-vasopressor therapy withdrawal end points) were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier procedure and median times to event were reported. The effects of treatments on these end points were estimated from adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models25 using baseline cortisol, cortisol response, McCabe classification, LOD score, arterial lactate levels, and PaO2/FIO2 results for the adjustment.8 Corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported. Proportionality among the event rates in the Cox models was assessed by the plot of the log (−log [survival function]) vs time. When the proportionality assumption was not upheld, Cox models were not used and only the Kaplan-Meier curves were reported along with log-rank tests. For 28-day survival, patients who were still alive at 28 days were treated as censored. For this end point, the number needed to treat at 28 days was estimated.26 For time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal, among patients who had more than 1 outcome event during the 28 days from randomization, time to the first event was used in the analyses. For this end point, the patients who died before vasopressor therapy could be withdrawn and those for whom vasopressor therapy could not be withdrawn during the 28 days from randomization were treated as censored. The effects of treatments on the frequency of fatal events (28-day, ICU, hospital and 1-year mortality rates) were estimated from logistic regression analysis using the same variables for the adjustment as the Cox models. Corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% CIs were reported. We also computed the 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year relative risks (RRs) of death along with their 95% CIs. The frequency of adverse events was compared between groups using the χ2 or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided.

Results
Study Description
From October 9, 1995, to February 23, 1999, 1326 patients were screened and 300 patients (placebo, 149; corticosteroids, 151) were included in the study (Figure 1). Interim analyses were performed on April 3, 1997, and April 20, 1998, after the evaluation of 114 and 220 patients, respectively. After each analysis, the independent main end point and safety monitoring board advised the study chairpersons to continue the study. We included the patient in the placebo group who died before study drugs could be administered in our intent-to-treat analysis. One patient in the corticosteroid group was excluded from the final analysis because of consent withdrawal. Among the 299 remaining patients, there were 229 nonresponders (placebo, 115; corticosteroids, 114) and 70 responders (placebo, 34; corticosteroids, 36).

Characteristics of Study Patients at Inclusion
At baseline, the 2 groups were balanced with respect to general characteristics (Table 1) and severity of illness (Table 2). Cortisol response to corticotropin was higher in the corticosteroid group than in the placebo group in the all-patients analysis, but the distribution of patients according to our 3-level prognostic classification8 was similar in the 2 groups. The type and site of infection and the type of organism involved were also similar in the 2 groups (Table 3). Finally, a blinded evaluation determined that appropriate antibiotic therapy, based on the site of infection and available cultures, was promptly (<24 hours from diagnosis of severe sepsis) started and continued for at least 7 days in most cases (ie, 95% in the placebo group, 91% in the corticosteroid group).

Mortality Distribution
Nonresponders
At day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 12 days in the placebo group and 24 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.47-0.95; P = .02; Figure 2A). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 7 (95% CI, 4-49).

Responders
At day 28, there were 18 deaths (53%) in the placebo group and 22 deaths (61%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 14 days in the placebo group and 16.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of survival distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .81) (Figure 2B).

All Patients
At day 28, there were 91 deaths (61%) in the placebo group and 82 deaths (55%) in the corticosteroid group. The median time to death was 13 days in the placebo group and 19.5 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .03) (Figure 2C). The number of patients needed to treat to save 1 additional life at day 28 is 8 (95% CI, 5-81).

Mortality Rates
Nonresponders
As mentioned above, at day 28, there were 73 deaths (63%) in the placebo group and 60 deaths (53%) in the corticosteroid group (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.97; P = .04). There were 81 deaths (70%) in the placebo group and 66 deaths (58%) in the corticosteroid group at the end of ICU stay (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00; adjusted OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89; P = .02). A similar significant difference was observed at the end of hospital stay. There were 88 deaths (77%) in the placebo group and 77 deaths (68%) in the corticosteroid group after 1 year of follow-up (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75-1.04; adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.31-1.04; P = .07) (Table 4).

Responders
There was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in responders (Table 4).

All Patients
There was no significant effect of corticosteroids on 28-day, ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality rates in all patients. For example, the ICU mortality is represented by RR, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.75-1.05), adjusted OR, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.02), P = .06 and year of follow-up is represented by RR, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.78-1.04), adjusted OR, 0.62 (95% CI, 0.36-1.05), P = .08 (Table 4).

Time-to-Vasopressor-Therapy Withdrawal
Nonresponders
The median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 10 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.91 (95% CI, 1.29-2.84; P = .001) (Figure 3A). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 46 patients (40%) in the placebo group and in 65 patients (57%) in the corticosteroid group.

Responders
The median time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal was 7 days in the placebo group and 9 days in the corticosteroid group. The proportionality assumption was not supported for the Cox model and comparison of time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal distributions was performed using a log-rank test (P = .49, Figure 3B). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 18 patients (53%) in the placebo group and in 18 patients (50%) in the corticosteroid group.

All Patients
The median time to vasopressor therapy withdrawal was 9 days in the placebo group and 7 days in the corticosteroid group. The HR estimated using a Cox model was 1.54 (95% CI, 1.10-2.16; P = .01; Figure 3C). At day 28, vasopressor therapy had been withdrawn in 64 patients (43%) in the placebo group and in 83 patients (55%) in the corticosteroid group.

Adverse Events
There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in the rates of adverse events possibly related to corticosteroids or vasopressors, or related to ICU invasive procedures (Table 5).

Comment
We found that a 7-day replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (50 mg intravenous bolus every 6 hours) and fludrocortisone (50 µg tablet once daily) significantly reduced 28-day mortality and duration of vasopressor administration in all patients with septic shock, in particular those with relative adrenal insufficiency. In addition, among the latter, corticosteroid therapy significantly reduced mortality during both ICU and hospital stays, and tended to reduce 1-year mortality. Our results indicate that, in this population, 1 additional life could be saved at day 28 for every 7 patients treated with corticosteroids. Replacement therapy had no significant effect on the same variables in patients who had septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency. If the power to detect differences in responders was lower than that in nonresponders due to the lower proportion of responders, it should be observed that no tendency toward efficacy (or deleterious effect) was observed in responders for any of the above mentioned variables. These results confirm the hypothesis on which the study was planned that patients with septic shock with relative adrenal insufficiency could benefit from replacement therapy.

Our results are consistent with a study of healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin27 and with 2 studies of patients with septic shock,12,13 that showed that low doses of hydrocortisone can restore vascular responsiveness to catecholamines. Our results are also consistent with those of 2 small trials showing that replacement therapy with hydrocortisone reduces the time-to-vasopressor-therapy withdrawal in septic shock.14,15 Finally, our study establishes that a short corticotropin test performed at early onset of septic shock is useful for identifying patients that could most benefit from replacement therapy with corticosteroids. However, it has to be stressed that the time required to obtain the results largely depends on the method used to measure cortisol (eg, enzymatic method, radioimmunoassay) and therefore that treatment should be started as soon as the test has been completed.

The sample size was calculated to detect a difference of 20% between the 2 groups of nonresponders on the 28-day mortality rate using a 1-sided formulation. Such a formulation was chosen because the preliminary reports that were available at the planning phase of the study22,23 had shown that for several days patients tolerated well 200 to 300 mg of hydrocortisone daily, and we had no interest in formally demonstrating a hypothetical deleterious effect of corticosteroids. However, as recommended by the 9th International Conference on Harmonization, at the time of analysis, all tests were performed using a 2-sided formulation and all reported P values were 2-sided. The sample size was also computed based on the assumptions of a mortality rate of 95% in the nonresponder placebo subgroup and a frequency of nonresponders of 40% in the population of patients with septic shock. In fact, the mortality rate in the nonresponder placebo subgroup (63%) was much lower than expected compared with the reports that were available at the planning phase of the study7,22 and with the hypothesis that patients with adrenal insufficiency would very likely die without hormone replacement. Conversely, the proportion of nonresponders (77%) was much higher than expected and the resulting increase in the sample size of nonresponders (from 108 to 229) may have favored the detection of a lower difference (10%) than expected between the 2 groups.

Several differences between the design of this positive study and previous negative studies28-33 deserve comment. First, our trial was focused on a very specific population who were presumed to benefit from corticosteroids because of relative adrenal insufficiency. Second, low doses of a combination of the natural hormone hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were used (as recommended to treat adrenal insufficiency)16 rather than high doses of a synthetic glucocorticoid compound. The addition of fludrocortisone to hydrocortisone was justified because primary adrenal insufficiency could not be ruled out16 since it has been shown that 40% to 65% of critically ill patients have high-plasma renin activity and low-plasma aldosterone concentrations.34,35 Moreover, in situations that require high amounts of active glucocorticoid, the reduction of fludrocortisone to cortisol can serve as a second source of cortisol in addition to that of adrenal glands.36 Third, patients were treated for a longer time (ie, 7 days) than those treated in previous trials. Indeed, recent work in healthy volunteers challenged with endotoxin37 and in patients with septic shock23,38 have shown that short courses of corticosteroid treatment may be followed by a rebound of the systemic inflammatory response.

In conclusion, in catecholamine-dependent septic shock patients, particularly those with relative adrenal insufficiency, a 7-day treatment with the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone is safe and associated with a significant reduction in short-term and long-term mortality. In practice, we suggest that all patients with catecholamine-dependent septic shock should be given the combination of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone as soon as a short corticotropin stimulation test is performed. When the results of the test are available, treatment may be withdrawn in responders and continued up to 7 days in nonresponders. Further studies are required to better determine the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroids to be given in this setting. The interest of a replacement therapy with corticosteroids in patients with septic shock without relative adrenal insufficiency deserves additional investigation.",0.75922686,"Yes, corticosteroids do reduce 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency. The study found that among patients who were nonresponders to the corticotropin test (indicating relative adrenal insufficiency), the use of low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the 28-day mortality rate. Specifically, 63% of patients in the placebo group died within 28 days compared to 53% in the corticosteroid group. The hazard ratio for mortality in the corticosteroid group was 0.67, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.47 to 0.95, and a P-value of 0.02, indicating a statistically significant reduction in mortality risk.

5,doc_13.txt,"Abstract
Importance  Adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy is suggested by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign in refractory septic shock only. The efficacy of hydrocortisone in patients with severe sepsis without shock remains controversial.

Objective  To determine whether hydrocortisone therapy in patients with severe sepsis prevents the development of septic shock.

Design, Setting, and Participants  Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted from January 13, 2009, to August 27, 2013, with a follow-up of 180 days until February 23, 2014. The trial was performed in 34 intermediate or intensive care units of university and community hospitals in Germany, and it included 380 adult patients with severe sepsis who were not in septic shock.

Interventions  Patients were randomly allocated 1:1 either to receive a continuous infusion of 200 mg of hydrocortisone for 5 days followed by dose tapering until day 11 (n = 190) or to receive placebo (n = 190).

Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was development of septic shock within 14 days. Secondary outcomes were time until septic shock, mortality in the intensive care unit or hospital, survival up to 180 days, and assessment of secondary infections, weaning failure, muscle weakness, and hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >150 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]).

Results  The intention-to-treat population consisted of 353 patients (64.9% male; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [14.4] years). Septic shock occurred in 36 of 170 patients (21.2%) in the hydrocortisone group and 39 of 170 patients (22.9%) in the placebo group (difference, −1.8%; 95% CI, −10.7% to 7.2%; P = .70). No significant differences were observed between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups for time until septic shock; mortality in the intensive care unit or in the hospital; or mortality at 28 days (15 of 171 patients [8.8%] vs 14 of 170 patients [8.2%], respectively; difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.6% to 6.7%; P = .86), 90 days (34 of 171 patients [19.9%] vs 28 of 168 patients [16.7%]; difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, −5.1% to 11.4%; P = .44), and 180 days (45 of 168 patients [26.8%] vs 37 of 167 patients [22.2%], respectively; difference, 4.6%; 95% CI, −4.6% to 13.7%; P = .32). In the hydrocortisone vs placebo groups, 21.5% vs 16.9% had secondary infections, 8.6% vs 8.5% had weaning failure, 30.7% vs 23.8% had muscle weakness, and 90.9% vs 81.5% had hyperglycemia.

Conclusions and Relevance  Among adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, use of hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of septic shock within 14 days. These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone in these patients.

Introduction
Despite decades of study and debate, the role of adjunctive “low-dose” hydrocortisone treatment (200-300 mg/d) in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock remains controversial.1 The current recommendation for hydrocortisone use is mainly based on 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs).2 In the study by Annane et al,3 hydrocortisone improved survival and reversal of septic shock in patients with relative adrenal insufficiency. In the CORTICUS study,4 septic shock was reversed more quickly but mortality was not significantly reduced. The higher risk of mortality and septic shock severity in the study by Annane and colleagues resulted in more restrictive recommendations for hydrocortisone use only in patients with inadequate response to fluid and vasopressor resuscitation.2 However, septic shock reversal in the CORTICUS study was reported to be significantly accelerated by the administration of hydrocortisone irrespective of the adrenal response to corticotropin. An international consensus statement recommended replacing the terms relative or absolute adrenal insufficiency, which reflect only adrenal cortisol release, by the critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) concept.5

Although meta-analyses report controversial results on mortality reduction by administration of corticosteroids,6,7 there is consistency regarding shock reversal irrespective of disease severity or the presence of CIRCI.5-7 In a smaller RCT in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), hydrocortisone significantly improved survival and prevented progression to shock.8 Furthermore, 2 recent RCTs9,10 and a meta-analysis11 revealed positive effects of steroids in patients with CAP. Assuming that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect a disease continuum, it was hypothesized that early hydrocortisone administration might prevent shock development owing to the attenuation of an exaggerated inflammatory response. To our knowledge, this is the first RCT investigating the effects of hydrocortisone to prevent progression to shock in patients with severe sepsis presenting without shock.

Methods
Study Design
The Hydrocortisone for Prevention of Septic Shock (HYPRESS) study is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The study was conducted in cooperation with the German Sepsis Competence Network (SepNet) and the Clinical Trial Centre Leipzig, which provided internet-based randomization and data capture, assurance of accuracy and completeness of data, biostatistical analysis, and pharmacovigilance. Monitoring of sites was performed on defined intervals. The protocol was approved by the responsible ethics committees of all 34 participating sites. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 2.

Study Patients
Patients were screened in intermediate care units or intensive care units (ICUs) of university and community hospitals for eligibility, and written informed consent was obtained from patients, patient-authorized representatives, or legal representatives. Patients were enrolled if they met all inclusion criteria (for details, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1): (1) provided informed consent; (2) had evidence of infection; (3) had evidence of a systemic response to infection, defined as at least 2 systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria12; and (4) had evidence of organ dysfunction present for not longer than 48 hours. The main exclusion criterion was septic shock. Other exclusion criteria were being younger than 18 years, having known hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or mannitol (placebo), or having a history of glucocorticoid medication with indication for continuation of therapy or other indications for treatment with glucocorticoids. Patients were not excluded for using etomidate within 72 hours before enrollment, using a short course of glucocorticoids within 72 hours before enrollment, or using topical or inhaled glucocorticoids.

Definitions
Septic shock was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension despite adequate volume status for longer than 4 hours (ie, mean arterial pressure <65 mm Hg, systolic arterial pressure <90 mm Hg, or the use of vasopressors to keep mean arterial pressure ≥65 mm Hg or systolic arterial pressure ≥90 mm Hg). Patients who had a transient need for vasopressors during initial resuscitation but were not hypotensive and did not use vasopressors for at least 2 hours were eligible for enrollment when septic shock was not present at the time of randomization. Adequate volume status was defined as a central venous pressure of 8 mm Hg or greater (≥12 mm Hg in ventilated patients) and a central venous oxygen saturation greater than 70%. For fluid replacement, patients were to receive at least 500 to 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300 to 500 mL of colloids over 30 minutes. The use of hydroxyethyl starch preparations was discouraged owing to possible harmful effects on kidney function.13,14 Use of vasopressors was defined as therapy with dopamine at a dosage of at least 5 µg/kg/min or with any dose of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vasopressin, or other vasopressors. For further details and definitions, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.

Randomization
Randomization was stratified by participating center and sex. It was performed with an internet-based computerized randomization tool that uses a modified version of the Pocock minimization algorithm15 with a random component to generate balanced 1:1 randomization in the strata at any time. All patients, study personnel, sponsors, medical staff, and nursing staff were blinded regarding the allocation of study medication throughout the entire study period.

Study Medication
The study medication (hydrocortisone and placebo) was produced and released by BAG Health Care GmbH. The medication was delivered in boxes, each containing 17 brown glass vials for 1 patient. Each vial contained 100 mg of lyophilized hydrocortisone hydrogen succinate or the same amount of lyophilized mannitol as placebo, which was indistinguishable from hydrocortisone. The medication was administered as an intravenous bolus of 50 mg, followed by a 24-hour continuous infusion of 200 mg on 5 days, 100 mg on days 6 and 7, 50 mg on days 8 and 9, and 25 mg on days 10 and 11. Hydrocortisone dose corresponded to those used in the 2 major RCTs performed earlier,3,4 which had shown significant effects on septic shock resolution. A continuous infusion was preferred to avoid possible undulation of the blood cortisol concentrations by bolus administration, which had been reported to complicate blood glucose control.16 A continuous infusion was also recommended in the recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.2 To reduce possible hemodynamic and immunological rebound effects,17 hydrocortisone was tapered over several days as in the CORTICUS study.4 Study medication was discontinued for safety reasons or when patients were discharged from the ICU or reached the primary end point.

End Points
The primary end point was the occurrence of septic shock within 14 days, which was assessed daily until day 14, or discharge from the ICU. Secondary end points were time until development of septic shock or death (whichever came first), mortality in the ICU and hospital, vital status at 28, 90, and 180 days, duration of stay in the ICU and hospital, organ dysfunctions (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, ranging from 0-24 with higher values indicating greater severity), duration of mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. In the subgroup of patients who underwent a corticotropin test at baseline, the occurrence of septic shock, mortality, length of stay (LOS) in the ICU or hospital, mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunctions (SOFA score), renal replacement therapy, and secondary infection were evaluated. Critical illness–related corticosteroid insufficiency was defined as an increase of cortisol of 9 µg/dL or less (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 27.588) 1 hour after stimulation with 250 µg of corticotropin (Synacthen). Frequency of delirium was assessed daily until ICU discharge by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale18,19 (ranging from −5 [unarousable; no response to voice or physical stimulation] to 4 [combative; overly combative or violent; immediate danger to staff]) to quantify the level of sedation and by the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU for detection of delirium. Adverse events were assessed until day 28, with special emphasis on muscle weakness, weaning failure, secondary infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding. All events not typically associated with the course of disease had to be reported (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).

Data Acquisition, Cortisol Measurement, and Patient Treatment
Disease severity was assessed by the SOFA score,20 Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (ranging from 0-163),21 Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (ranging from 0-71),22 and Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3 (ranging from 0-217) (with higher scores indicating greater severity on all instruments).23 Serum cortisol concentration was batch analyzed by mass spectrometry in a reference laboratory in blood samples stored at −80°C and taken before and 60 minutes after administration of 250 µg of corticotropin at baseline. All patients had to be treated according to guidelines of the German Sepsis Society13 (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1).

Statistical Analysis
The study was planned to detect an absolute difference of 15% in the proportion of patients with septic shock within 14 days with a significance level of .05 and a power of 0.8. The difference of 15% was postulated to be a meaningful difference that could change clinical practice, and was supported by similar differences of hydrocortisone on 7-day septic shock resolution in patients with septic shock,24 assuming that hydrocortisone might be as effective in preventing septic shock as in resolving it.

Assuming 40% of patients in the placebo group had septic shock,8,25-27 169 evaluable patients per arm were required. Accounting for an expected dropout rate of about 10%, 190 patients per arm (380 in total) had to be included. The statistical analysis was conducted consistent with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The primary end point was assessed by χ2 test; heterogeneity between centers with more than 10 recruited patients was assessed by I2. Secondary end points were analyzed by χ2 test, Fisher exact test, t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or log-rank test, as appropriate. All reported P values are 2-sided, and P < .05 was regarded as statistically significant. Secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing because these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Planned subgroup analyses included the ITT population and the per-protocol (PP) population, administration of study medication for at least 48 hours, medical and surgical patients, and patients with pneumonia. Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed for CIRCI, delirium, and CAP. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to investigate adjusted treatment effects. Two interim analyses were performed after recruitment of one-third and two-thirds of the planned sample size. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc), R version 3.1.0 (R Foundation), and SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp) statistical software. For details of the statistical analyses, see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 1.

Results
Patient Population
From January 13, 2009, to August 27, 2013, 9953 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock were screened at 34 study sites for eligibility. A total of 380 patients were randomized to receive hydrocortisone (n = 190) or placebo (n = 190). The median time from screening to enrollment was 12.5 hours (interquartile range [IQR], 6-21 hours) in the placebo group and 14 hours (IQR, 6.5-23 hours) in the hydrocortisone group (P = .49). The ITT population excluded 27 patients and included 353 patients (64.9% male; mean [SD] age, 65.0 [14.4] years) (Figure 1). The PP population consisted of 322 patients, and the safety analysis set included 375 patients. Six patients (2 in the placebo group, 4 in the hydrocortisone group) received a reduced dose (<80% of total dose according to protocol). Ten patients (5 in the placebo group, 5 in the hydrocortisone group) received an increased dose (quotient of applied dose and expected dose >1.2). These patients were excluded from the PP analysis. Follow-up was conducted until February 23, 2014.

Baseline Characteristics and Treatment During Study
Treatment arms were comparable regarding age, type of admission to the ICU, severity of disease or organ dysfunction, use of glucocorticoids or etomidate within 72 hours before randomization, initial treatment and vital signs within 6 hours after diagnosis of severe sepsis, administration of study medication, antibiotic therapy, and treatment characteristics during the study. Pneumonia was slightly more frequent in patients who received placebo (Table 1 and eTables 1, 2, and 3 in Supplement 1).

Primary End Point
There was no significant difference in the proportion of septic shock after 14 days between patients who received hydrocortisone or placebo in the ITT or PP population (Table 2). In the ITT population, septic shock occurred in 36 of 170 patients (21.2%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 39 of 170 patients (22.9%) in the placebo group (difference, −1.8%; 95% CI, −10.7% to 7.2%; P = .70). In the PP population, septic shock occurred in 29 of 155 patients (18.7%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 33 of 156 patients (21.2%) in the placebo group (difference, −2.4%; 95% CI, −11.5% to 6.6%; P = .59). In addition, no significant difference between the groups was observed regarding time to septic shock development (Figure 2), or in time to septic shock in those patients who developed septic shock (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Subgroup analysis of medical or surgical patients, patients with pneumonia, or study medication treatment for at least 48 hours did not reveal a benefit for shock prevention (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). To exclude a center effect, 11 sites that recruited at least 10 patients (n = 279) were analyzed; there was no heterogeneity for the primary end point (I2 = 0%; P = .74).

Secondary End Points
There were no significant differences in 28-day, 90-day, 180-day, ICU, or hospital all-cause mortality; LOS in the ICU or hospital; ventilation- or renal replacement–free days; or median SOFA score until day 14 between patients treated with placebo or hydrocortisone (Table 2 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1). At 28 days, mortality occurred in 15 of 171 patients (8.8%) in the hydrocortisone group and 14 of 170 patients (8.2%) in the placebo group (difference, 0.5%; 95% CI, −5.6% to 6.7%; P = .86). At 90 days, mortality occurred in 34 of 171 patients (19.9%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 28 of 168 patients (16.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, −5.1% to 11.4%; P = .44). At 180 days, mortality occurred in 45 of 168 patients (26.8%) in the hydrocortisone group vs 37 of 167 patients (22.2%) in the placebo group (difference, 4.6%; 95% CI, −4.6% to 13.7%; P = .32). Analysis of the PP population revealed no significant differences for secondary end points between the treatment arms. A post hoc analysis of 54 patients with CAP did not reveal significant differences for the primary or secondary end points between patients treated with hydrocortisone (n = 24) or placebo (n = 30).

Adverse Effects
There were more episodes of hyperglycemia (blood glucose level >150 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]) in the hydrocortisone group (169 of 186 patients [90.9%]) than in the placebo group (154 of 189 patients [81.5%]) (difference, 9.4%; 95% CI, 2.4% to 16.4%; P = .009) (Table 3). The total amount of administered insulin was not significantly different between the hydrocortisone and placebo groups (safety set analysis: mean [SD], 264.6 [312.2] vs 212.2 [246.8] IU, respectively; difference, 52.4 IU; 95% CI, −21.8 to 126.7 IU; P = .17) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). Two patients developed severe hypertension during hydrocortisone administration, which required antihypertensive therapy. Both patients recovered without sequelae. Secondary infections, weaning failure, muscle weakness, hypernatremia, or other adverse events were not significantly different between treatment groups (Table 3).

Critical Illness–Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency
Cortisol data from corticotropin tests were available from 206 of 353 patients (58.4%), of whom 69 (33.5%) had CIRCI. Baseline characteristics were comparable between patients with and without CIRCI (eTable 4 in Supplement 1). In the placebo group, septic shock occurred in 10 of 37 patients with CIRCI (27.0%) and in 9 of 66 patients without CIRCI (13.6%) (difference, 13.4%; 95% CI, −2.1% to 30.5%; P = .09). In a multivariate analysis, SOFA score (per SOFA point: odds ratio = 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.49; P = .007) and CIRCI (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% CI, 1.13-5.91; P = .03) at baseline, but not age or sex, were independently prognostic for development of septic shock (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). In this subpopulation of 206 patients, there was no significant difference regarding the primary or secondary end points between patients with or without CIRCI who received hydrocortisone or placebo (eTable 6 in Supplement 1).

Delirium
Delirium was assessed by the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU in 286 of 353 patients (81.0%). The median number of assessments per patient was 7 (IQR, 4-12) in the placebo group and 6.5 (IQR, 4-10.5) in the hydrocortisone group (difference, 1.61 assessments; 95% CI, −0.36 to 3.58 assessments; P = .21). Twenty-six patients were excluded from analysis owing to low Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score or incomplete data. In the remaining 260 patients, delirium was less frequent in patients who received hydrocortisone than in those who received placebo (11 of 130 patients [8.5%] vs 25 of 130 patients [19.2%], respectively; difference, −10.8%; 95% CI, −19.2% to −2.3%; P = .01). The results remained significant after exclusion of another 60 patients (28 from the placebo group, 32 from the hydrocortisone group) who were diagnosed by the investigator to have no delirium but had at least 1 incomplete delirium assessment or had only 1 baseline assessment (n = 6 in the hydrocortisone group) (with delirium occurring in 11 of 98 patients [11.2%] in the hydrocortisone group vs 25 of 102 patients [24.5%] in the placebo group; difference, −13.3%; 95% CI, −23.7% to −2.6%; P = .01) (Table 2).

Discussion
In this RCT, low-dose hydrocortisone did not prevent the evolution from severe sepsis to septic shock. There were no significant differences between treatment groups with regard to mortality or LOS in the ICU or hospital, or mortality up to 180 days. Patients treated with hydrocortisone had a significantly higher risk of developing hyperglycemia and a lower risk of developing delirium in a post hoc analysis.

The rationale for this study was based on the notion that severe sepsis and septic shock reflect stages of a disease continuum with increasing mortality.28 Occurrence of septic shock was chosen as the primary outcome variable for the following reasons. First, hydrocortisone in septic shock showed conflicting results in terms of mortality, but consistent hemodynamic effects and faster septic shock resolution.6,24 Second, administration of hydrocortisone was associated with immunomodulatory effects including reduced inducible nitric oxide formation—a key mediator of septic shock pathophysiology.17 Thus, it was hypothesized that attenuation of inflammation in early severe sepsis could prevent progression to shock. Third, this hypothesis was supported by data of Confalonieri et al8 showing that septic shock was prevented by hydrocortisone in patients with CAP. Fourth, because occurrence of septic shock is associated with an increased risk of mortality,28 it was hypothesized that prevention of septic shock leading to organ dysfunction could also affect secondary outcome variables such as LOS in the ICU or mortality. If prolonged administration of hydrocortisone was able to prevent septic shock development, this beneficial effect of hydrocortisone could outweigh adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, which can be readily treated by administration of insulin. Vasopressor-dependent (volume-resistant) septic shock in patients with sepsis is still the key indication for suggesting hydrocortisone in the current international guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign.2 Hence, it seems plausible to take this as a primary end point if prevention of septic shock is tested. We assumed a rate of septic shock of 40% in patients with severe sepsis based on previous studies8,25-27 and data from the SepNet Clinical Trials Group. However, owing to different study populations, effect sizes, and septic shock criteria, only a rough estimation was possible (see limitations described later). According to recommendations of the German Sepsis Society to transfer patients with severe sepsis to an intermediate care unit or ICU, only patients treated in these units were enrolled in HYPRESS. This was different from a recent retrospective cohort study of patients with sepsis and similar lactate values but lower hospital mortality (7.9% mortality in the study by Liu et al29 vs 13.1% mortality in this study), who were treated predominantly in the general ward.29

However, the current study did not show a protective effect on shock development, time to septic shock, mortality, or LOS in the ICU or hospital. The results are in contrast to a small study in 46 patients with severe CAP, in which hydrocortisone administration was associated with improved survival and significantly lower rates of septic shock. This study was prematurely stopped after an interim analysis owing to improvement of oxygenation and hospital mortality.8 The presented data did not support that hydrocortisone was more effective with regard to the primary or secondary end points in patients with pneumonia or in the subgroup of patients with CAP. However, recent larger RCTs of steroids in patients with CAP did not reveal reduction of mortality but did show some beneficial effects on other outcomes. In 304 non-ICU patients, a 4-day treatment with 5 mg of dexamethasone reduced median hospital LOS by 1 day.30 Another RCT enrolled 120 patients with severe CAP and a high inflammatory response who received methylprednisolone at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg twice daily or placebo for 5 days.10 Primary end points were parameters of early (<72 hours) or late (72-120 hours) treatment failure. Treatment failure rates were lower in patients who received steroids than in those who received placebo (13% vs 32%, respectively; P = .02), with late radiographic progression as the only significantly different parameter; notably, late septic shock was rare and less frequent in patients who received steroids than in those who received placebo (0 vs 4 patients, respectively). In the largest RCT to date, with 785 patients with CAP, patients received either 50 mg of prednisone or placebo for 7 days.9 The primary end point was time to clinical stability for at least 24 hours. Treatment with prednisone shortened time to clinical stability by 1 to 4 days irrespective of severity of CAP, and it shortened time to hospital discharge and duration of antibiotic therapy by 1 day. Thus, there is some evidence that moderate doses of steroids may be more effective in patients with CAP than other causes of sepsis.11

Another interesting finding in this study was that despite a higher risk of septic shock in patients with CIRCI, there was no detectable difference in septic shock development between treatment groups; however, sample size and event numbers were small. The results are in line with results of the CORTICUS trial, in which effects of hydrocortisone on septic shock resolution were independent from CIRCI. Moreover, in a CORTICUS subgroup analysis, etomidate administration was associated with a significantly higher risk for CIRCI and 28-day mortality. However, hydrocortisone treatment did not reduce mortality in patients with CIRCI who received etomidate.31 Whether combined biomarkers may be more suitable to detect eligible patients needs further investigation. A subgroup analysis of patients with CAP showed most effects in patients who had low basal cortisol levels combined with high proinflammatory cytokine profiles.32

The results from this study do not support an increased risk for secondary infections. Reasonable concerns were amplified by results of the CORTICUS trial, which showed higher numbers of secondary infections including new sepsis and septic shock in patients who received hydrocortisone.4 A Bayesian analysis, mainly based on CORTICUS results, of patients with septic shock reported an increased risk of infections.33 However, other studies in patients with septic shock,3 acute respiratory distress syndrome,34 trauma,35 or CAP8-10,30 and a meta-analysis7 did not report any increased risk.

An unexpected finding was that delirium developed less frequently in patients treated with hydrocortisone. Indeed, several observational studies reported an association between high serum cortisol concentration and delirium after noncardiac36 and cardiac 37 surgery and severe sepsis or septic shock.38 There is compelling evidence that systemic inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium, but it remains controversial whether high cortisol concentration mirrors an activation of the stress response to cope with inflammation, or whether delirium is caused by high cortisol concentration. A prospective cohort study in 330 mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung injury reported a significant dose-independent association between systemic corticosteroid administration and development of delirium.39 However, in an RCT with 737 patients undergoing cardiac surgery who received dexamethasone, 1 mg/kg, or placebo at anesthesia induction did not reveal a significant difference of postoperative delirium between treatment groups.40 Thus, the results question the concept of cortisol-induced delirium in critical illness and provide some evidence of protective effects of prolonged administration of low-dose hydrocortisone in early severe sepsis.

There are limitations of the study to be addressed. First, inclusion in the trial was possible only after informed consent could be obtained, so that patients who developed septic shock early may have been missed. Second, data from corticotropin tests were available in a subgroup of 206 patients only, because adrenal function assessment was not an absolute inclusion criterion and therefore was not performed at all study sites or in all patients at a single site. Analyses of CIRCI were post hoc and should be regarded as hypothesis generating only. Third, mortality in the study population was more comparable to the mortality reported in recent studies with CAP9,10,30 than to the mortality (approximately 30%) reported in the study by Confalonieri et al8; thus, it cannot be excluded that hydrocortisone would have been more effective in patients with a higher risk of death. Fourth, data on delirium should be interpreted with caution because patients had to be excluded owing to incomplete data sets, only 1 daily assessment was performed in most patients, and interrater reliability was not assessed. Analyses were performed post hoc and results should therefore be regarded as hypothesis generating. Fifth, secondary analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing, as these statistical comparisons were performed with exploratory rather than confirmatory intention. Adjustment for clustering within site was not performed because site was a stratification factor for randomization. Sixth, the observed rate of septic shock in the placebo group (23%; 95% CI, 17%-30%) was lower than originally presumed for sample size calculation (40%). The point estimate of the difference of septic shock occurrences was −1.8% (ie, close to 0) with a 95% CI of −10.7% to 7.2%. Hence, the trial gives no indication of a clinically relevant major benefit of hydrocortisone treatment, which it was designed to detect.

Conclusions
Among adults with severe sepsis not in septic shock, the use of hydrocortisone compared with placebo did not reduce the risk of septic shock within 14 days. These findings do not support the use of hydrocortisone in these patients.",0.77247417,"The study referenced in the abstract does not focus on patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency. Instead, it investigates the effect of hydrocortisone in patients with severe sepsis who are not in septic shock. According to the results of this specific study, hydrocortisone did not significantly reduce 28-day mortality among these patients. Therefore, based on this study alone, we cannot conclude that corticosteroids effectively reduce 28-day mortality in patients with septic shock and relative adrenal insufficiency. Additional studies, like the ones mentioned in the introduction section, would need to be considered to address the question for the specific population of septic shock with relative adrenal insufficiency.",0.5
