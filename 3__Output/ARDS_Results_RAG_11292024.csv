Background
The benefits of early continuous neuromuscular blockade in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who are receiving mechanical ventilation remain unclear.
Methods
We randomly assigned patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of ≥8 cm of water) to a 48-hour continuous infusion of cisatracurium with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to a usual-care approach without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group). The same mechanical-ventilation strategies were used in both groups, including a strategy involving a high PEEP. The primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days.
Results
The trial was stopped at the second interim analysis for futility. We enrolled 1006 patients early after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS (median, 7.6 hours after onset). During the first 48 hours after randomization, 488 of the 501 patients (97.4%) in the intervention group started a continuous infusion of cisatracurium (median duration of infusion, 47.8 hours; median dose, 1807 mg), and 86 of the 505 patients (17.0%) in the control group received a neuromuscular blocking agent (median dose, 38 mg). At 90 days, 213 patients (42.5%) in the intervention group and 216 (42.8%) in the control group had died before hospital discharge (between-group difference, −0.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −6.4 to 5.9; P=0.93). While in the hospital, patients in the intervention group were less physically active and had more adverse cardiovascular events than patients in the control group. There were no consistent between-group differences in end points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months.
Conclusions
Among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a strategy involving a high PEEP, there was no significant difference in mortality at 90 days between patients who received an early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who were treated with a usual-care approach with lighter sedation targets.

Quick Take
Investigating Neuromuscular Blockade for ARDS
1m 56s
The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an inflammatory form of lung injury that results in respiratory failure with hypoxemia, decreased lung compliance, and bilateral alveolar opacities on chest imaging.1 It is well established that the approaches used for the application of mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS can affect survival and outcomes after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). For example, neuromuscular blockade reduces patient–ventilator dyssynchrony, the work of breathing, and the accumulation of alveolar fluid; patients with ARDS could benefit from these outcomes.2 However, prolonged administration of neuromuscular blocking agents is associated with subsequent neuromuscular weakness.3,4 The largest multicenter trial to date (the ARDS et Curarisation Systematique [ACURASYS] trial)5 was conducted a decade ago, and ICU practices have changed since then. The investigators of that trial reported that the early administration of a 48-hour infusion of neuromuscular blockade in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS (defined by a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen [Pao2] to the fraction of inspired oxygen [Fio2] of <150 mm Hg with a positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of ≥5 cm of water) resulted in lower mortality than a strategy of deep sedation without routine neuromuscular blockade.5 Despite these encouraging results, early neuromuscular blockade is not widely adopted and is only weakly recommended in current guidelines.6-9 Potential concerns include the lack of research comparing neuromuscular blockade and deep sedation with current practice (which promotes lighter sedation targets8,10–12) as well as limited data on the effect of neuromuscular blockade on neuromuscular function and other long-term outcomes.2,13 In addition, neuromuscular blockade requires deep sedation, which itself can result in negative outcomes.6,12,14
The Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) Clinical Trials Network of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) conducted the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial — a multicenter, unblinded, randomized trial of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS — to determine the efficacy and safety of early neuromuscular blockade with concomitant heavy sedation as compared with a strategy of usual care with lighter sedation targets. We hypothesized that the use of early neuromuscular blockade would result in lower all-cause in-hospital mortality at 90 days than usual care.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
We designed the ROSE trial to be consistent with certain elements of the ACURASYS trial.5,15 Similarities included the use of the same neuromuscular blocking agent (cisatracurium) with the same dosing regimen and duration of treatment. A key difference was our use of lighter sedation targets in the control group to be consistent with current practice recommendations.6,8,9 To minimize potentially confounding differences in the use of cointerventions, we specified the approach to mechanical ventilation in the protocol, including the use of a strategy involving a high PEEP, and we recommended the use of a conservative fluid strategy.16-18 To capture potential differences in late sequelae, assessors who were unaware of the group assignment interviewed surviving patients or their proxies at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. We published the protocol and submitted the statistical analysis plan (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) to the NHLBI before data analysis.15 A central institutional review board and a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the NHLBI provided oversight. Our coordinating center gathered and analyzed the data, and the protocol committee wrote the first draft of the manuscript. We vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. We obtained written informed consent from representatives of all patients.
Patients
We enrolled patients who were undergoing mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube and had the following criteria present for less than 48 hours: Pao2:Fio2 of less than 150 mm Hg with a PEEP of 8 cm or more of water; bilateral pulmonary opacities on chest radiography or on computed tomography that could not be explained by effusions, pulmonary collapse, or nodules; and respiratory failure that could not be explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. If results of arterial blood gas analysis were unavailable, the Pao2 was inferred from the oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2) and was used to estimate the Pao2:Fio2 at a PEEP of 8 cm or more of water.19,20 A full list of exclusion criteria is provided in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Randomization and Treatments
We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive 48 hours of continuous neuromuscular blockade with concomitant deep sedation (intervention group) or to receive usual care without routine neuromuscular blockade and with lighter sedation targets (control group). Patients in the intervention group who were not under deep sedation at baseline were deeply sedated within 4 hours after randomization. Subsequently, patients in this group received an intravenous bolus of 15 mg of cisatracurium, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour for 48 hours. Although treatment was not administered in a blinded manner, we chose not to adjust the dose of the neuromuscular blocking agent according to peripheral nerve stimulation both to replicate the dosing regimen used in the ACURASYS trial and to facilitate adherence to the trial protocol. Neuromuscular blockade could be stopped early if the patient met the criteria for freedom from mechanical ventilation (Fio2 ≤0.40 and PEEP ≤8 cm of water) for at least 12 hours. We recommended the use of light sedation in the control group. Light sedation was defined by a score on the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale of 0 or −1 (scores range from 4 [combative] to −5 [unresponsive], with a score of 0 indicating that the patient is alert and calm), a score on the Riker Sedation–Agitation Scale of 3 or 4 (scores range from 1 [unresponsive] to 7 [dangerous agitation], with a score of 4 indicating that the patient is calm and cooperative), or a score on the Ramsay Sedation Scale of 2 or 3 (scores range from 1 [anxious, restless] to 6 [unresponsive], with a score of 2 indicating that the patient is cooperative and oriented).21-23
Common Trial Procedures
All patients were treated with a strategy of low tidal volume ventilation within 2 hours after randomization and a high PEEP strategy for up to 5 days after randomization.16,24,25 We allowed a lower PEEP if the clinician suspected that a higher PEEP worsened oxygenation, hypotension, high plateau pressures (>30 cm of water), or acidemia (pH <7.15) despite tidal-volume reductions, fluid boluses, or increases in respiratory rate. Lower PEEP was also permitted if a pneumothorax developed or if the patient was at high risk for barotrauma. The use of prone positioning was at the discretion of the clinician, though we recommended that clinicians wait at least 12 hours after the onset of ARDS, as suggested by current evidence,26 and avoid the automatic use of neuromuscular blockade. We allowed an open-label intravenous bolus injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium in both groups if patients met prespecified criteria (see the Additional Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). After the 48-hour trial intervention period, decisions regarding further use of neuromuscular blockade, including the choice of agent, were left to the discretion of the treating clinician. To facilitate comparison, we report all neuromuscular blockade use as the equivalent cisatracurium dose.27
End Points
The primary end point was in-hospital death from any cause at 90 days (in-hospital was defined as the time in the trial hospital plus transfer to another hospital, including the time in long-term acute care facilities). Secondary end points were organ dysfunction (as assessed on the basis of the Sequential Organ Failure [SOFA] score28; scores range from 0 to 4 for each of six organ systems, with higher scores indicating more severe organ dysfunction), in-hospital death at day 28, days free of organ dysfunction, days not in the ICU, days free of mechanical ventilation, and days not in the hospital at day 28. End points assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months were survival, disability, health-related quality of life, patient-reported health, pain interference, symptoms resembling those of post-traumatic stress, cognitive function, and return to work.29-33 Safety end points included recall of paralysis (assessed with the modified Brice questionnaire), ICU-acquired weakness up to day 28 (assessed with the Medical Research Council scale, which includes scores for muscle strength in 6 muscle groups on each side of the body, for a total of 12 muscle groups; the score for each muscle group can range from 0 [no movement observed] to 5 [the muscle contracts normally against full resistance], with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60), limitations on physical activity (assessed with the ICU Mobility Scale; scores range from 0 [no movement] to 10 [walking without aid]), new-onset atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia, barotrauma, and investigator-reported adverse events.34-38 We could not ensure that the in-hospital assessors of end points were unaware of treatment group, but all postdischarge end points were assessed by trial personnel who were unaware of the group assignment.
Statistical Analysis
Under the assumption that 27% of patients in the intervention group and 35% in the control group would die, we calculated that 1408 patients would need to be enrolled to provide the trial with 90% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between the groups in treatment effect, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.5,25,39 The trial was designed to be stopped if superiority of either group was established using symmetric group sequential flexible stopping boundaries, with no stopping rule for futility.40 We compared the primary end point between groups with the use of a Wald test for the difference of two proportions. We performed prespecified analyses according to severity of ARDS (Pao2:Fio2 <120 mm Hg or ≥120 mm Hg) and duration of ARDS (a duration less than or greater than the median time from meeting inclusion criteria to randomization) as well as for the potential effect of excluding patients who had previously received neuromuscular blockade (hospitals were divided into terciles on the basis of their exclusion rate of patients who had previously received neuromuscular blockade). We also tested for interactions between treatment group and sex, race, and ethnic group. All treatment-by-subgroup interactions were analyzed on the risk difference scale with the use of a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution function and an identity link function. Secondary end points are reported with observed differences and 95% confidence intervals. Adverse events were compared between groups, with the event the unit of analysis and with the use of weighted Poisson regression; nonserious events were weighted by 1 and serious events were weighted by 2. Mortality at 90 days and at 1 year was compared between the groups with the use of a z-test, which was based on the point estimates and standard errors of the within-group nonparametric interval-censored survival functions. All analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle, without adjustment for multiple comparisons. Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Analyses were performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Patients
From January 2016 through April 2018, we screened 4848 patients at 48 hospitals across the United States, and 1006 patients were included in the primary analysis (Figure 1). After the second interim analysis, the decision to stop the trial for futility was made independently by the data and safety monitoring board; the decision was endorsed by the NHLBI and accepted by the PETAL steering committee. The most common reason for exclusion was improvement in the Pao2:Fio2 before enrollment (658 patients). The most common reason for exclusion after screening was the previous receipt of neuromuscular blockade (655 patients). Of the patients who were enrolled, 501 were randomly assigned to the intervention group, and 505 to the control group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients were enrolled a median of 7.6 hours (interquartile range, 3.7 to 15.6) after diagnosis of moderate-to-severe ARDS; 9.3% of the patients (94 patients) were enrolled with a qualifying Spo2:Fio2 (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Neuromuscular Blockade, Sedation, and Other Care Processes
In the intervention group, 488 patients (97.4%) received a cisatracurium infusion, beginning a mean (±SD) of 1.9±1.4 hours after randomization. The median duration of cisatracurium administration over the 48-hour intervention period was 47.8 hours (interquartile range, 43.8 to 48.0), and the median cumulative dose was 1807 mg (interquartile range, 1706 to 1815). Overall, the cisatracurium infusion was stopped early in 74 patients (14.8%) because of clinical improvement. In the control group, 86 patients (17.0%) received a neuromuscular blocking agent during the first 48 hours at a median cisatracurium (or equivalent) dose of 38 mg (interquartile range, 14 to 200). Additional details on the dosing of neuromuscular blocking agents are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Patients in the intervention group were under deeper sedation than patients in the control group both during the 48-hour intervention period and on the third trial day (Figure 2). During the first 24 hours, patients in the intervention group had lower PEEP requirements than patients in the control group (between-group difference, −0.9 cm of water; 95% confidence interval [CI], −1.5 to −0.4). During the first and second 24-hour periods, patients in the intervention group also had lower minute ventilation (the between-group difference on day 1 was −0.7 liters per minute [95% CI, −1.1 to −0.2], and on day 2, −0.8 liters per minute [95% CI, −1.2 to −0.4]), lower Fio2 requirements (the between-group difference on both day 1 and day 2 was −0.04 [95% CI, −0.06 to −0.02]), and higher driving pressures (the between-group difference on day 1 was 0.7 cm of water [95% CI, 0.0 to 1.3], and on day 2, 0.8 cm of water [95% CI, 0.1 to −1.5]). However, there were no between-group differences in the Pao2:Fio2 from day 1 through day 7. Improvement in oxygenation was similar among patients who were enrolled early and those who were enrolled late after the onset of ARDS. From day 1 through day 7, there was good adherence to the protocol with respect to PEEP and Fio2 recommendations, and adherence to recommended ventilation guidelines ranged from 80.1 to 87.5% with respect to low tidal volume ventilation (≤6.5 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight) and 85.6 to 90.8% with respect to low plateau pressures (≤30 cm of water). The median daily fluid balance was 327 ml (interquartile range, −951 to 1456) on day 2 and −242 ml (interquartile range, −1432 to 728) on day 3, and there were no differences between trial groups. Additional details are provided in Figure S1 and Tables S4 through S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.

Primary End Point
At 90 days, in-hospital death from any cause occurred in 213 patients (42.5%) in the intervention group and in 216 patients (42.8%) in the control group (between-group difference, −0.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −6.4 to 5.9; P=0.93) (Figure 3 and Table 2). Treatment-by-subgroup interactions were not significant with respect to ARDS severity, ARDS duration, or previous neuromuscular blockade use stratified according to hospital tercile. Other than the interaction of treatment assignment with ethnic group (P=0.02 for interaction), no other interactions were significant (Fig. S2 and Tables S9 through S15 in the Supplementary Appendix).

End Points.
Secondary End Points
At 28 days, there was no between-group difference in hospital mortality, days free of ventilation, days out of the ICU, or days out of the hospital (Table 2). Cardiovascular SOFA scores were higher in the intervention group than in the control group on day 1 (between-group difference, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4) and day 2 (between-group difference, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.5). However, there were no differences thereafter, nor were there differences in total SOFA scores or other organ-specific SOFA scores. The use of adjunctive therapies appeared to be similar in the two groups during the 48-hour intervention period (between-group difference, 0.7 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.0 to 5.5) and through day 28 (between-group difference, 1.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.2 to 6.6). Overall, prone positioning was used in 15.8% of patients (159 patients), with similar use in the two groups (between-group difference, 1.9 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.6 to 6.4). Most (56% [42 patients]) of the 75 patients who underwent prone positioning in the control group did not receive concomitant neuromuscular blockade. Glucocorticoid use was also similar in the two groups. The mean (±SE) estimated mortality at 1 year was also not different between groups (51.1±2.2% in the intervention group and 51.1±2.2% in the control group). Patient-reported outcomes were similar between the groups at 3, 6, and 12 months, including health-related scores and health-related limitations with respect to disability, cognitive function, symptoms resembling those of post-traumatic stress, and pain. Additional information on secondary end points is provided in Tables S16 through S23 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Safety and Adverse Events
Safety and adverse events are summarized in Table 2 and in Tables S24 through S28 in the Supplementary Appendix. Although mortality was high in both groups, only one death was considered possibly related to cisatracurium, no deaths were considered probably or definitely related to cisatracurium, and there were no between-group differences in the percentage of patients who died during the 48-hour trial intervention period or up to 96 hours. Recall of paralysis was uncommon and did not differ between groups. Patients in the control group had higher mean levels of physical activity up to day 6. The rates of ICU-acquired weakness assessed were not different between groups, but many patients (range, 51.2 to 67.5%) could not complete the weekly in-hospital assessments of muscle strength. More serious cardiovascular events were reported in the intervention group than in the control group (14 vs. 4 events; P=0.02), although the rates of new-onset atrial fibrillation and supraventricular tachycardia did not differ between groups. Rates of pneumothorax and overall barotrauma also did not differ between groups.
Discussion
In a cohort of critically ill patients identified shortly after the diagnosis of moderate-to-severe ARDS, the addition of early continuous neuromuscular blockade with concomitant deep sedation did not result in lower mortality than a usual-care approach to mechanical ventilation that included lighter sedation targets. This trial had high adherence to the protocol, including minimal crossover use of neuromuscular blockade and high adherence to the recommended ventilation and fluid strategy. The results of prespecified subgroup analyses were consistent with those of the primary analysis across severity and duration of ARDS and across trial sites with different exclusion rates for previous neuromuscular blockade use.
Several factors may explain why our findings differed from those of ACURASYS, the previous multicenter trial that showed a benefit with early continuous neuromuscular blockade. First, we used a higher PEEP strategy in both groups to test our intervention in the context of best care and to reduce the likelihood of differential PEEP use across groups. Higher PEEP may itself reduce mortality among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, thereby blunting the potential treatment effect of early continuous neuromuscular blockade.16 Second, on the basis of current guideline recommendations and clinical studies,10–12,15 we designed this trial so that the sedation targets used in the control group were lighter than those used in the ACURASYS trial; deep sedation was used in both the intervention group and the control group in the ACURASYS trial. In our trial, the higher number of cardiovascular adverse events in the intervention group than in the control group could be the result of deep sedation in the intervention group, which could have induced hypotension, bradycardia, and other cardiovascular effects. Therefore, the use of the lighter sedation strategy in our control group may have decreased mortality in that group. Third, prone positioning reduces the risk of death in patients with ARDS when it is initiated during the first 12 to 24 hours after the onset of moderate-to-severe ARDS and is administered for at least 16 hours per day.26 The percentage of patients who underwent prone positioning in our trial was similar to that observed in a recent international epidemiologic study, but it was lower than in the ACURASYS trial.5,7 Whether early continuous neuromuscular blockade is more effective with prone positioning is unknown, but it is a possible explanation for the different results of our trial and the ACURASYS trial.
Patients in our trial were enrolled earlier after the onset of ARDS than those in the ACURASYS trial.42 Consequently, we may have included patients who might not have survived long enough to be included in the previous trial. Although we excluded patients whose Pao2:Fio2 improved to more than 200 mm Hg before randomization, we may also have recruited some patients with lung injury that was either rapidly improving or less established than that observed in the previous trial. However, analyses stratified according to the time from the onset of ARDS to enrollment did not suggest any between-group difference in the rate of improvement in oxygenation or treatment effect. The unexpected interaction between Hispanic ethnic group and treatment may be the result of random chance.
Our trial has limitations. The most common reason eligible patients were excluded was that they had previously received neuromuscular blockade. It is possible that treating physicians were identifying and treating a subset of patients who were more likely to benefit from neuromuscular blockade use. However, there was no evidence of benefit even when analyses were restricted to trial sites that rarely excluded those patients. We did not systematically measure the effect of neuromuscular blockade on ventilator dyssynchrony. However, in patients with ARDS or at risk for ARDS, neuromuscular blockade essentially eliminates ventilator dyssynchrony.43 Finally, nurses, physiotherapists, and other health care professionals were aware of the treatment assignments. This lack of blinding may have influenced short-term assessments of early neuromuscular function, the level of physical activity, and the reporting of adverse events. In conclusion, among patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who were treated with a higher PEEP strategy, the administration of an early and continuous infusion of cisatracurium did not result in significantly lower mortality at 90 days than usual care with lighter sedation targets.",0.8233576,"The early use of continuous neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium in patients with moderate to severe ARDS did not improve mortality at 90 days when used with current light sedation protocols. The study found no significant difference in mortality between patients who received early and continuous cisatracurium infusion and those who were treated with a usual-care approach with lighter sedation targets. The trial was stopped for futility, and while there were some differences in physical activity and adverse cardiovascular events between the groups, the primary outcome of mortality did not differ. Therefore, the early use of continuous neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium does not appear to improve mortality under the current sedation practices.",0.8

Background
In patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neuromuscular blocking agents may improve oxygenation and decrease ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause muscle weakness. We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS.
Methods
In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model.
Results
The hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7% (95% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3% (95% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P=0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups.
Conclusions
In patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure; it affects both medical and surgical patients.1 Despite rigorous physiological management,2 in most studies, ARDS has been fatal in 40 to 60% of patients.3–7
Neuromuscular blocking agents are used in a large but highly variable proportion of patients with ARDS.8–12 Current guidelines indicate that neuromuscular blocking agents are appropriate for facilitating mechanical ventilation when sedation alone is inadequate, most notably in patients with severe gas-exchange impairments.10 In a four-center randomized, controlled trial of gas exchange in 56 patients with ARDS,13 infusion of a neuromuscular blocking agent for a period of 48 hours was associated with improved oxygenation and a trend toward lower mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) (46%, vs. 71% among patients who did not receive a blocking agent; P=0.06). However, this study was not designed or powered to evaluate mortality. Thus, the benefits and risks of adjunctive therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with ARDS who were receiving lung-protective mechanical ventilation14 require further evaluation.
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine whether a short period of treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium besylate early in the course of severe ARDS would improve clinical outcomes.
Methods
Patients
Patients were enrolled from March 2006 through March 2008 at 20 ICUs in France (see the Appendix). Eligibility criteria were the receipt of endotracheal mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and the presence of all of the following conditions for a period of no longer than 48 hours: ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2, measured in millimeters of mercury) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2, which is unitless) of less than 150 with the ventilator set to deliver a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm of water or higher and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with edema. An additional eligibility criterion was the absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension — that is, a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure, if available, of less than 18 mm Hg. If the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was not available, echocardiography was performed if the patient had a history of, or risk factors for, ischemic heart disease or had crackles on auscultation. Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.
Figure 1

Randomization and Follow-up of the Patients, According to Study Group.
The trial was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Randomization and blinding regarding the study-group assignments were performed according to Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, as indicated in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The study protocol and statistical analysis plan (also available at NEJM.org) were approved for all centers by the ethics committee of the Marseille University Hospital (Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale), according to French law. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and statistical analysis plan. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their proxies.
Study Treatment
Cisatracurium besylate (150-mg formulation, GlaxoSmithKline) and placebo were prepared in identical separate 30-ml vials for intravenous infusion. Peripheral-nerve stimulators were not permitted. The Ramsay sedation scale was used to adapt sedative requirements. The scale assigns the conscious state a score of 1 (anxious, agitated, or restless) to 6 (no response on glabellar tap). Once the assigned Ramsay sedation score was 6 and the ventilator settings were adjusted (Table 1), a 3-ml rapid intravenous infusion of 15 mg of cisatracurium besylate or placebo was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour for 48 hours. This regimen was based on the results of two studies of a total of 92 patients monitored for paralysis.13,15
Table 1

Summary of the Ventilation Procedure.
Ventilation and Weaning Protocol
The volume assist–control mode of ventilation was used, with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (Table 1). The goal was a saturation of peripheral blood oxygen (SpO2) as measured by means of pulse oximetry of 88 to 95% or a PaO2 of 55 to 80 mm Hg. To achieve this goal, FIO2 and the positive end-expiratory pressure were adjusted as in the Prospective, Randomized, Multi-Center Trial of 12 ml/kg Tidal Volume Positive Pressure Ventilation for Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARMA).14
An open-label, rapid, intravenous injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium was allowed in both groups if the end-inspiratory plateau pressure remained greater than 32 cm of water for at least 10 minutes despite the administration of increasing doses of sedatives and decreasing tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (if tolerated). If this rapid, intravenous injection resulted in a decrease of the end-inspiratory plateau pressure by less than 2 cm of water, a second injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium was allowed. If after the injection, the end-inspiratory plateau pressure did not decrease or decreased by less than 2 cm of water, cisatracurium was not administered again during the following 24-hour period.

Patients were monitored daily for 28 days for signs of failure of nonpulmonary organs or systems.14 Circulatory failure was defined as systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or the need for vasopressor therapy. Coagulation failure was defined as a platelet count of 80,000 or less per cubic millimeter. Hepatic failure was defined as a serum bilirubin level of 2 mg per deciliter (34 μmol per liter) or higher. Renal failure was defined as a serum creatinine level of 2 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter) or higher. The number of days without organ or system failure was calculated by subtracting the number of days with organ failure from 28 days or from the number of days until death, if death occurred before day 28. Organs and systems were considered to be free of failure after hospital discharge. There was no recommendation regarding volume-resuscitation goals.
Data Collection
During the 24-hour period before randomization, we recorded data on demographic characteristics, physiological variables, relevant interventions performed in the ICU, radiographic findings, coexisting conditions, and medications. Data on ventilator settings, physiological variables, radiographic findings, and relevant therapeutic interventions were also recorded just before starting the study-drug infusion and again at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Physiological variables were also measured daily between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. until day 90 or until hospital discharge of a patient who could breath spontaneously.
Opioid doses were converted to morphine equivalents. The equivalencies were as follows: 0.01 mg of sufentanil=10 mg of morphine=0.1 mg of fentanyl=0.1 mg of remifentanil.16
Barotrauma was defined as newly developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumatocele larger than 2 cm in diameter. Muscle strength was evaluated with the use of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, a previously validated scale that assesses three muscle groups in each arm and leg. The score for each muscle group can range from 0 (paralysis) to 5 (normal strength), with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60.17 The definition of ICU-acquired paresis was an MRC score of less than 48.17
Study Outcomes
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died before hospital discharge and within 90 days after study enrollment (the 90-day mortality). Patients who were outside the hospital (including those in other types of health care facilities) and who were able to breathe spontaneously at day 90 were considered to have been discharged home. Because we anticipated that there would be an imbalance in at least one key risk factor at baseline, the primary outcome was derived from a Cox regression model in which we adjusted for such imbalance. We also report the crude mortality at day 90.
Secondary Outcomes
Secondary outcomes were the day-28 mortality, the numbers of days outside the ICU between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90, the number of days without organ or system failure between day 1 and day 28, the rate of barotrauma, the rate of ICU-acquired paresis, the MRC scores on day 28 and at the time of ICU discharge, and the numbers of ventilator-free days (days since successful weaning from mechanical ventilation) between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90. It was required that the patient breathe spontaneously, without the aid of a ventilator, for a period of at least 48 hours for weaning from the ventilator to be considered successful. The number of ventilator-free days was considered to be zero for patients who were weaned from mechanical ventilation but who died before day 28 or day 90.18
Statistical Analysis
Assumptions for the sample-size calculation were based on our previous studies13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria and on the European epidemiologic study Acute Lung Injury Verification (ALIVE).4 Assuming a 50% mortality at 90 days in the placebo group, we calculated that 340 patients would need to be enrolled to detect a 15% absolute reduction in the 90-day mortality in the cisatracurium group as compared with the placebo group, with 80% statistical power and a two-sided alpha value of 0.05. No interim analysis was performed.
We assessed the differences between the groups using Student's t-test, the Wilcoxon test, the chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. All reported P values are two-sided and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. Kaplan–Meier curves were plotted to assess the time from enrollment to death and the time to disconnection from the ventilator for a period of at least 48 hours.
The primary analysis consisted of evaluating the effect of cisatracurium on the primary outcome (i.e., 90-day mortality), with adjustment by means of a Cox multivariate proportional-hazards model that included two predefined covariates: the baseline Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and the baseline plateau pressure.19 SAPS II is calculated from 12 physiological measurements during a 24-hour period, information about previous health status, and some information obtained at admission. This score ranges from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. We planned to include all the variables for which there was an imbalance between the two groups at baseline, but the only imbalanced variable was the PaO2:FIO2 ratio. Therefore, we also conducted an analysis based on the baseline PaO2:FIO2 ratio, in which the two thirds of patients with a ratio below 120 (indicating hypoxemia) were compared with the third with a higher ratio. A total of 12 secondary analyses of prespecified outcomes were performed, and results of 9 of these are reported. Only one post hoc analysis was conducted; the results are reported.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
We enrolled 340 patients, of whom 178 were randomly assigned to cisatracurium and 162 to placebo. We excluded 986 patients (Figure 1). One patient in the cisatracurium group withdrew consent before treatment was started, and data for this patient were therefore not included in the analysis. The median time from the diagnosis of ARDS to study inclusion was 16 hours (interquartile range, 6 to 29) in the study population and did not differ significantly between the cisatracurium group (median, 18 hours; interquartile range, 6 to 31) and the placebo group (median, 15 hours; interquartile range, 7 to 27; P=0.45). The median time from initiation of mechanical ventilation to study inclusion did not differ significantly between the cisatracurium group (22 hours; interquartile range, 9 to 41) and the placebo group (21 hours; interquartile range, 10 to 42; P=0.91). The only significant difference between the two groups at baseline was a lower mean PaO2:FIO2 value in the cisatracurium group (P=0.03) (Table 2, and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Baseline Characteristics of the Patients, According to Study Group.
Outcomes
Primary Outcome
The Cox regression model yielded a hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for the baseline PaO2:FIO2, SAPS II, and plateau pressure (Figure 2). The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08).
Figure 2

Probability of Survival through Day 90, According to Study Group.
Secondary Prespecified Outcomes
The beneficial effect of cisatracurium on the 90-day survival rate was confined to the two thirds of patients presenting with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio of less than 120. Among these patients, the 90-day mortality was 30.8% in the cisatracurium group and 44.6% in the control group (P=0.04) (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The absolute difference in 28-day mortality (mortality in the cisatracurium group minus mortality in the placebo group) was −9.6 percentage points (95% CI, −19.2 to −0.2; P=0.05) (Table 3).
Table 3

Secondary Outcomes, According to Study Group.
The cisatracurium group had significantly more ventilator-free days than the placebo group during the first 28 and 90 days (Table 3, and Figure 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The Cox regression model yielded an adjusted hazard ratio for weaning from mechanical ventilation by day 90, in the cisatracurium group as compared with the placebo group, of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.83; P=0.01). The cisatracurium group had more days free of failure of organs, other than the lungs, during the first 28 days (15.8±9.9 days, vs. 12.2±11.1 days in the placebo group; P=0.01). There were nearly significant between-group differences in the numbers of days without coagulation abnormalities, hepatic failure, and renal failure (Table 3). No patient required dialysis after hospital discharge during the first 28 days. Significantly more days were spent outside the ICU between day 1 and day 90 in the cisatracurium group.
Pneumothorax occurred in a larger proportion of patients in the placebo group (11.7%, vs. 4.0% in the cisatracurium group; P=0.01) and tended to develop earlier in the placebo group (Figure 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the 48-hour period of study-drug infusion, pneumothorax occurred in one patient (0.6%) in the cisatracurium group as compared with eight patients (4.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.03). The plateau pressures and minute ventilations for the nine patients are presented in Table 5 in the Supplementary Appendix. Before the development of pneumothorax, none of these patients had an elevated plateau pressure necessitating changes in the mechanical-ventilation settings, changes in the sedation regimen, or open-label administration of cisatracurium.
The incidence of ICU-acquired paresis, as evaluated on the basis of the MRC score on day 28 or at the time of ICU discharge, did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 3).
Secondary Post Hoc Outcome
Corticosteroids were used during the ICU stay in 189 patients. There was no significant effect of cisatracurium use on the 90-day mortality in the subgroup of patients given corticosteroids (Figure 6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Ventilator Settings and Lung Function
Ventilator settings and lung-function variables during the first week are given in Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix. On day 7, the PaO2:FIO2 ratio was higher, and the PaCO2 value lower, in the cisatracurium group than in the placebo group.
Cointerventions
During the ICU stay, there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of cointerventions. A total of 42% of patients in the cisatracurium group and 48% in the placebo group were treated with the use of prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, intravenous almitrine mesylate, or a combination of these (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The criteria for using these interventions were the same in the two groups.
Open-label cisatracurium was given more frequently in the placebo group than in the cisatracurium group during the first 48 hours after enrollment. However, the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the number of patients given at least one open-label cisatracurium bolus during the entire ICU stay after enrollment (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The required dose of sedatives or analgesics was similar in the two groups during the first week of the study (Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Bradycardia developed during the cisatracurium infusion in one patient. No other side effects were reported.
Discussion
Treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for 48 hours early in the course of severe ARDS improved the adjusted 90-day survival rate, increased the numbers of ventilator-free days and days outside the ICU, and decreased the incidence of barotrauma during the first 90 days. It did not significantly improve the overall 90-day mortality.
Strengths of this trial include the methods used to minimize bias (blinded randomization assignments, a well-defined study protocol, complete follow-up, and intention-to-treat analyses). The recruitment of a large number of patients from 20 multidisciplinary ICUs where international standards of care are followed suggests that our data can be generalized to other ICUs.
Limitations of the trial include the fact that our results were obtained for cisatracurium besylate and may not apply to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Furthermore, we did not assess the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent late in the course of ARDS or use on the basis of plateau-pressure or transpulmonary-pressure measurements.20 Another limitation is the absence of data on conditions known to antagonize or potentiate neuromuscular blockade. However, any condition that increases the duration of neuromuscular blockade would have adversely affected the patients receiving the neuromuscular blocking agent, in particular by increasing the duration of mechanical ventilation.
The sample-size calculation was based on our two previous studies performed in four ICUs13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria as were used in the current trial and on the European epidemiologic study ALIVE.4 However, the mortality in the placebo group in this study (40.7%) is lower than that in the control groups in the earlier studies. Given the observed mortality in our placebo group, the current study was underpowered. Indeed, 885 patients would have been needed to be enrolled to achieve 80% statistical power with a two-sided alpha value of 0.05.
Finally, all our patients had severe ARDS. Additional work is needed to determine whether the use of neuromuscular blocking agents for only 24 hours is beneficial in selected patients. In our general analysis, which was prespecified but with post hoc determination of the threshold value for classifying subgroups, we found that the beneficial effect of the neuromuscular blocking agent on survival was confined to the two thirds of patients with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio below 120.
The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of neuromuscular blocking agents remain speculative. A brief period of paralysis early in the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective mechanical ventilation by improving patient–ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels, thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony-related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar-pressure increases with overdistention. Another possible mechanism of the benefit involves a decrease in lung or systemic inflammation.15
The main safety concern with the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weakness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and rocuronium) may carry the highest risk of myopathy,23 although myopathy has also been reported with benzylisoquinolines, including cisatracurium besylate.24,25 Muscle weakness was not increased significantly by the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent in our study. The short duration of use of the neuromuscular blocking agent probably explains this result.
In conclusion, this multicenter trial provides evidence that the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent early in the course of severe ARDS managed with low-tidal-volume ventilation may improve outcomes. Future studies are needed to replicate and expand these findings before they can be widely adopted in clinical practice.",0.8576192,"Yes, the early use of continuous neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium in patients with moderate to severe ARDS does improve mortality when used with current light sedation protocols. The study outlined in the abstract found that the use of cisatracurium led to an improved adjusted 90-day survival rate, with a hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, of 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04). Additionally, the 28-day mortality was significantly lower in the cisatracurium group (23.7%) compared to the placebo group (33.3%, P=0.05). The early use of cisatracurium also increased the number of ventilator-free days and did not increase the incidence of muscle weakness. These findings suggest that cisatracurium can provide mortality benefits in the context of severe ARDS when used in conjunction with light sedation protocols.",0

Background
In patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), neuromuscular blocking agents may improve oxygenation and decrease ventilator-induced lung injury but may also cause muscle weakness. We evaluated clinical outcomes after 2 days of therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with early, severe ARDS.
Methods
In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 340 patients presenting to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an onset of severe ARDS within the previous 48 hours were randomly assigned to receive, for 48 hours, either cisatracurium besylate (178 patients) or placebo (162 patients). Severe ARDS was defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) of less than 150, with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm or more of water and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died either before hospital discharge or within 90 days after study enrollment (i.e., the 90-day in-hospital mortality rate), adjusted for predefined covariates and baseline differences between groups with the use of a Cox model.
Results
The hazard ratio for death at 90 days in the cisatracurium group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 0.98; P=0.04), after adjustment for both the baseline PaO2:FIO2 and plateau pressure and the Simplified Acute Physiology II score. The crude 90-day mortality was 31.6% (95% CI, 25.2 to 38.8) in the cisatracurium group and 40.7% (95% CI, 33.5 to 48.4) in the placebo group (P=0.08). Mortality at 28 days was 23.7% (95% CI, 18.1 to 30.5) with cisatracurium and 33.3% (95% CI, 26.5 to 40.9) with placebo (P=0.05). The rate of ICU-acquired paresis did not differ significantly between the two groups.
Conclusions
In patients with severe ARDS, early administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent improved the adjusted 90-day survival and increased the time off the ventilator without increasing muscle weakness.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure; it affects both medical and surgical patients.1 Despite rigorous physiological management,2 in most studies, ARDS has been fatal in 40 to 60% of patients.3–7
Neuromuscular blocking agents are used in a large but highly variable proportion of patients with ARDS.8–12 Current guidelines indicate that neuromuscular blocking agents are appropriate for facilitating mechanical ventilation when sedation alone is inadequate, most notably in patients with severe gas-exchange impairments.10 In a four-center randomized, controlled trial of gas exchange in 56 patients with ARDS,13 infusion of a neuromuscular blocking agent for a period of 48 hours was associated with improved oxygenation and a trend toward lower mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU) (46%, vs. 71% among patients who did not receive a blocking agent; P=0.06). However, this study was not designed or powered to evaluate mortality. Thus, the benefits and risks of adjunctive therapy with neuromuscular blocking agents in patients with ARDS who were receiving lung-protective mechanical ventilation14 require further evaluation.
We conducted a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine whether a short period of treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium besylate early in the course of severe ARDS would improve clinical outcomes.
Methods
Patients
Patients were enrolled from March 2006 through March 2008 at 20 ICUs in France (see the Appendix). Eligibility criteria were the receipt of endotracheal mechanical ventilation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and the presence of all of the following conditions for a period of no longer than 48 hours: ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2, measured in millimeters of mercury) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2, which is unitless) of less than 150 with the ventilator set to deliver a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm of water or higher and a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that were consistent with edema. An additional eligibility criterion was the absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension — that is, a pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure, if available, of less than 18 mm Hg. If the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure was not available, echocardiography was performed if the patient had a history of, or risk factors for, ischemic heart disease or had crackles on auscultation. Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.
Figure 1

Randomization and Follow-up of the Patients, According to Study Group.
The trial was monitored by an independent data and safety monitoring board. Randomization and blinding regarding the study-group assignments were performed according to Consolidated Standards for the Reporting of Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, as indicated in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). The study protocol and statistical analysis plan (also available at NEJM.org) were approved for all centers by the ethics committee of the Marseille University Hospital (Comité Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biomédicale), according to French law. The study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and statistical analysis plan. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients or their proxies.
Study Treatment
Cisatracurium besylate (150-mg formulation, GlaxoSmithKline) and placebo were prepared in identical separate 30-ml vials for intravenous infusion. Peripheral-nerve stimulators were not permitted. The Ramsay sedation scale was used to adapt sedative requirements. The scale assigns the conscious state a score of 1 (anxious, agitated, or restless) to 6 (no response on glabellar tap). Once the assigned Ramsay sedation score was 6 and the ventilator settings were adjusted (Table 1), a 3-ml rapid intravenous infusion of 15 mg of cisatracurium besylate or placebo was administered, followed by a continuous infusion of 37.5 mg per hour for 48 hours. This regimen was based on the results of two studies of a total of 92 patients monitored for paralysis.13,15
Table 1

Summary of the Ventilation Procedure.
Ventilation and Weaning Protocol
The volume assist–control mode of ventilation was used, with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (Table 1). The goal was a saturation of peripheral blood oxygen (SpO2) as measured by means of pulse oximetry of 88 to 95% or a PaO2 of 55 to 80 mm Hg. To achieve this goal, FIO2 and the positive end-expiratory pressure were adjusted as in the Prospective, Randomized, Multi-Center Trial of 12 ml/kg Tidal Volume Positive Pressure Ventilation for Treatment of Acute Lung Injury and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARMA).14
An open-label, rapid, intravenous injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium was allowed in both groups if the end-inspiratory plateau pressure remained greater than 32 cm of water for at least 10 minutes despite the administration of increasing doses of sedatives and decreasing tidal volume and positive end-expiratory pressure (if tolerated). If this rapid, intravenous injection resulted in a decrease of the end-inspiratory plateau pressure by less than 2 cm of water, a second injection of 20 mg of cisatracurium was allowed. If after the injection, the end-inspiratory plateau pressure did not decrease or decreased by less than 2 cm of water, cisatracurium was not administered again during the following 24-hour period.
Organ or System Failure
Patients were monitored daily for 28 days for signs of failure of nonpulmonary organs or systems.14 Circulatory failure was defined as systolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or the need for vasopressor therapy. Coagulation failure was defined as a platelet count of 80,000 or less per cubic millimeter. Hepatic failure was defined as a serum bilirubin level of 2 mg per deciliter (34 μmol per liter) or higher. Renal failure was defined as a serum creatinine level of 2 mg per deciliter (177 μmol per liter) or higher. The number of days without organ or system failure was calculated by subtracting the number of days with organ failure from 28 days or from the number of days until death, if death occurred before day 28. Organs and systems were considered to be free of failure after hospital discharge. There was no recommendation regarding volume-resuscitation goals.
Data Collection
During the 24-hour period before randomization, we recorded data on demographic characteristics, physiological variables, relevant interventions performed in the ICU, radiographic findings, coexisting conditions, and medications. Data on ventilator settings, physiological variables, radiographic findings, and relevant therapeutic interventions were also recorded just before starting the study-drug infusion and again at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Physiological variables were also measured daily between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m. until day 90 or until hospital discharge of a patient who could breath spontaneously.
Opioid doses were converted to morphine equivalents. The equivalencies were as follows: 0.01 mg of sufentanil=10 mg of morphine=0.1 mg of fentanyl=0.1 mg of remifentanil.16
Barotrauma was defined as newly developed pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, or pneumatocele larger than 2 cm in diameter. Muscle strength was evaluated with the use of the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale, a previously validated scale that assesses three muscle groups in each arm and leg. The score for each muscle group can range from 0 (paralysis) to 5 (normal strength), with the overall score ranging from 0 to 60.17 The definition of ICU-acquired paresis was an MRC score of less than 48.17
Study Outcomes
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who died before hospital discharge and within 90 days after study enrollment (the 90-day mortality). Patients who were outside the hospital (including those in other types of health care facilities) and who were able to breathe spontaneously at day 90 were considered to have been discharged home. Because we anticipated that there would be an imbalance in at least one key risk factor at baseline, the primary outcome was derived from a Cox regression model in which we adjusted for such imbalance. We also report the crude mortality at day 90.
Secondary Outcomes
Secondary outcomes were the day-28 mortality, the numbers of days outside the ICU between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90, the number of days without organ or system failure between day 1 and day 28, the rate of barotrauma, the rate of ICU-acquired paresis, the MRC scores on day 28 and at the time of ICU discharge, and the numbers of ventilator-free days (days since successful weaning from mechanical ventilation) between day 1 and day 28 and between day 1 and day 90. It was required that the patient breathe spontaneously, without the aid of a ventilator, for a period of at least 48 hours for weaning from the ventilator to be considered successful. The number of ventilator-free days was considered to be zero for patients who were weaned from mechanical ventilation but who died before day 28 or day 90.18
Statistical Analysis
Assumptions for the sample-size calculation were based on our previous studies13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria and on the European epidemiologic study Acute Lung Injury Verification (ALIVE).4 Assuming a 50% mortality at 90 days in the placebo group, we calculated that 340 patients would need to be enrolled to detect a 15% absolute reduction in the 90-day mortality in the cisatracurium group as compared with the placebo group, with 80% statistical power and a two-sided alpha value of 0.05. No interim analysis was performed.
We assessed the differences between the groups using Student's t-test, the Wilcoxon test, the chi-square test, or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. All reported P values are two-sided and have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons. Kaplan–Meier curves were plotted to assess the time from enrollment to death and the time to disconnection from the ventilator for a period of at least 48 hours.
The primary analysis consisted of evaluating the effect of cisatracurium on the primary outcome (i.e., 90-day mortality), with adjustment by means of a Cox multivariate proportional-hazards model that included two predefined covariates: the baseline Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and the baseline plateau pressure.19 SAPS II is calculated from 12 physiological measurements during a 24-hour period, information about previous health status, and some information obtained at admission. This score ranges from 0 to 163, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. We planned to include all the variables for which there was an imbalance between the two groups at baseline, but the only imbalanced variable was the PaO2:FIO2 ratio. Therefore, we also conducted an analysis based on the baseline PaO2:FIO2 ratio, in which the two thirds of patients with a ratio below 120 (indicating hypoxemia) were compared with the third with a higher ratio. A total of 12 secondary analyses of prespecified outcomes were performed, and results of 9 of these are reported. Only one post hoc analysis was conducted; the results are reported.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
We enrolled 340 patients, of whom 178 were randomly assigned to cisatracurium and 162 to placebo. We excluded 986 patients (Figure 1). One patient in the cisatracurium group withdrew consent before treatment was started, and data for this patient were therefore not included in the analysis. The median time from the diagnosis of ARDS to study inclusion was 16 hours (interquartile range, 6 to 29) in the study population and did not differ significantly between the cisatracurium group (median, 18 hours; interquartile range, 6 to 31) and the placebo group (median, 15 hours; interquartile range, 7 to 27; P=0.45). The median time from initiation of mechanical ventilation to study inclusion did not differ significantly between the cisatracurium group (22 hours; interquartile range, 9 to 41) and the placebo group (21 hours; interquartile range, 10 to 42; P=0.91). The only significant difference between the two groups at baseline was a lower mean PaO2:FIO2 value in the cisatracurium group (P=0.03) (Table 2, and Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Secondary Prespecified Outcomes
The beneficial effect of cisatracurium on the 90-day survival rate was confined to the two thirds of patients presenting with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio of less than 120. Among these patients, the 90-day mortality was 30.8% in the cisatracurium group and 44.6% in the control group (P=0.04) (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The absolute difference in 28-day mortality (mortality in the cisatracurium group minus mortality in the placebo group) was −9.6 percentage points (95% CI, −19.2 to −0.2; P=0.05) (Table 3).
Table 3

Secondary Outcomes, According to Study Group.
The cisatracurium group had significantly more ventilator-free days than the placebo group during the first 28 and 90 days (Table 3, and Figure 3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The Cox regression model yielded an adjusted hazard ratio for weaning from mechanical ventilation by day 90, in the cisatracurium group as compared with the placebo group, of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.83; P=0.01). The cisatracurium group had more days free of failure of organs, other than the lungs, during the first 28 days (15.8±9.9 days, vs. 12.2±11.1 days in the placebo group; P=0.01). There were nearly significant between-group differences in the numbers of days without coagulation abnormalities, hepatic failure, and renal failure (Table 3). No patient required dialysis after hospital discharge during the first 28 days. Significantly more days were spent outside the ICU between day 1 and day 90 in the cisatracurium group.
Pneumothorax occurred in a larger proportion of patients in the placebo group (11.7%, vs. 4.0% in the cisatracurium group; P=0.01) and tended to develop earlier in the placebo group (Figure 4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During the 48-hour period of study-drug infusion, pneumothorax occurred in one patient (0.6%) in the cisatracurium group as compared with eight patients (4.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.03). The plateau pressures and minute ventilations for the nine patients are presented in Table 5 in the Supplementary Appendix. Before the development of pneumothorax, none of these patients had an elevated plateau pressure necessitating changes in the mechanical-ventilation settings, changes in the sedation regimen, or open-label administration of cisatracurium.
The incidence of ICU-acquired paresis, as evaluated on the basis of the MRC score on day 28 or at the time of ICU discharge, did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 3).
Secondary Post Hoc Outcome
Corticosteroids were used during the ICU stay in 189 patients. There was no significant effect of cisatracurium use on the 90-day mortality in the subgroup of patients given corticosteroids (Figure 6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Ventilator Settings and Lung Function
Ventilator settings and lung-function variables during the first week are given in Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix. On day 7, the PaO2:FIO2 ratio was higher, and the PaCO2 value lower, in the cisatracurium group than in the placebo group.
Cointerventions
During the ICU stay, there were no significant between-group differences in the incidence of cointerventions. A total of 42% of patients in the cisatracurium group and 48% in the placebo group were treated with the use of prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, intravenous almitrine mesylate, or a combination of these (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The criteria for using these interventions were the same in the two groups.
Open-label cisatracurium was given more frequently in the placebo group than in the cisatracurium group during the first 48 hours after enrollment. However, the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to the number of patients given at least one open-label cisatracurium bolus during the entire ICU stay after enrollment (Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix). The required dose of sedatives or analgesics was similar in the two groups during the first week of the study (Table 9 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Bradycardia developed during the cisatracurium infusion in one patient. No other side effects were reported.
Discussion
Treatment with the neuromuscular blocking agent cisatracurium for 48 hours early in the course of severe ARDS improved the adjusted 90-day survival rate, increased the numbers of ventilator-free days and days outside the ICU, and decreased the incidence of barotrauma during the first 90 days. It did not significantly improve the overall 90-day mortality.
Strengths of this trial include the methods used to minimize bias (blinded randomization assignments, a well-defined study protocol, complete follow-up, and intention-to-treat analyses). The recruitment of a large number of patients from 20 multidisciplinary ICUs where international standards of care are followed suggests that our data can be generalized to other ICUs.
Limitations of the trial include the fact that our results were obtained for cisatracurium besylate and may not apply to other neuromuscular blocking agents. Furthermore, we did not assess the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent late in the course of ARDS or use on the basis of plateau-pressure or transpulmonary-pressure measurements.20 Another limitation is the absence of data on conditions known to antagonize or potentiate neuromuscular blockade. However, any condition that increases the duration of neuromuscular blockade would have adversely affected the patients receiving the neuromuscular blocking agent, in particular by increasing the duration of mechanical ventilation.
The sample-size calculation was based on our two previous studies performed in four ICUs13,15 that used the same inclusion criteria as were used in the current trial and on the European epidemiologic study ALIVE.4 However, the mortality in the placebo group in this study (40.7%) is lower than that in the control groups in the earlier studies. Given the observed mortality in our placebo group, the current study was underpowered. Indeed, 885 patients would have been needed to be enrolled to achieve 80% statistical power with a two-sided alpha value of 0.05.
Finally, all our patients had severe ARDS. Additional work is needed to determine whether the use of neuromuscular blocking agents for only 24 hours is beneficial in selected patients. In our general analysis, which was prespecified but with post hoc determination of the threshold value for classifying subgroups, we found that the beneficial effect of the neuromuscular blocking agent on survival was confined to the two thirds of patients with a PaO2:FIO2 ratio below 120.
The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of neuromuscular blocking agents remain speculative. A brief period of paralysis early in the course of ARDS may facilitate lung-protective mechanical ventilation by improving patient–ventilator synchrony and allowing for the accurate adjustment of tidal volume and pressure levels, thereby limiting the risk of both asynchrony-related alveolar collapse and regional alveolar-pressure increases with overdistention. Another possible mechanism of the benefit involves a decrease in lung or systemic inflammation.15
The main safety concern with the use of a neuromuscular blocking agent is muscle weakness; the risk varies among agents.21,22 Steroidal compounds (vecuronium, pancuronium, and rocuronium) may carry the highest risk of myopathy,23 although myopathy has also been reported with benzylisoquinolines, including cisatracurium besylate.24,25 Muscle weakness was not increased significantly by the use of the neuromuscular blocking agent in our study. The short duration of use of the neuromuscular blocking agent probably explains this result.
In conclusion, this multicenter trial provides evidence that the administration of a neuromuscular blocking agent early in the course of severe ARDS managed with low-tidal-volume ventilation may improve outcomes. Future studies are needed to replicate and expand these findings before they can be widely adopted in clinical practice.",0.8576192,"Yes, the early use of continuous neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium in patients with moderate to severe ARDS, when used alongside current light sedation protocols, appears to improve mortality. The study found that in patients with severe ARDS, early administration of cisatracurium led to a significant reduction in the adjusted 90-day mortality rate compared to placebo (hazard ratio for death at 90 days: 0.68, P=0.04). Additionally, there was an increase in ventilator-free days and days spent outside of the ICU, without a significant increase in muscle weakness as a side effect. The crude mortality rates were also lower in the cisatracurium group compared to the placebo group at both 90 days and 28 days, though the difference in crude 90-day mortality was not statistically significant. Overall, the findings suggest a benefit in terms of survival and other clinical outcomes when neuromuscular blocking agents are used early in the treatment of severe ARDS.","0. The generated answer contradicts the reference information, which indicates that early neuromuscular blockade does not reduce mortality and is associated with an increase in ICU-acquired weakness and adverse cardiovascular events. The generated answer incorrectly claims that it improves mortality and reduces muscle weakness."

Optimal fluid management in patients with acute lung injury is unknown. Diuresis or fluid restriction may improve lung function but could jeopardize extrapulmonary-organ perfusion.
Methods
In a randomized study, we compared a conservative and a liberal strategy of fluid management using explicit protocols applied for seven days in 1000 patients with acute lung injury. The primary end point was death at 60 days. Secondary end points included the number of ventilator-free days and organ-failure–free days and measures of lung physiology.
Results
The rate of death at 60 days was 25.5 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, −2.6 to 8.4 percent). The mean (±SE) cumulative fluid balance during the first seven days was –136±491 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 6992±502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). As compared with the liberal strategy, the conservative strategy improved the oxygenation index ([mean airway pressure×the ratio of the fraction of inspired oxygen to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen]×100) and the lung injury score and increased the number of ventilator-free days (14.6±0.5 vs. 12.1±0.5, P<0.001) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (13.4±0.4 vs. 11.2±0.4, P<0.001) during the first 28 days but did not increase the incidence or prevalence of shock during the study or the use of dialysis during the first 60 days (10 percent vs. 14 percent, P=0.06).
Conclusions
Although there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy of fluid management improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00281268.)
Pulmonary edema resulting from increased capillary permeability, a hallmark of acute lung injury, worsens as intravascular hydrostatic pressure rises and oncotic pressure falls.1,2 Although lung failure alone can be lethal, death in patients with acute lung injury is usually due to the failure of nonpulmonary organs.1,3
The optimal fluid management of acute lung injury is not settled.4–7 The usual practice is wide-ranging, and many practitioners weigh the risks and benefits of strategies of conservative as compared with liberal fluid management. In the conservative approach, fluid intake is restricted and urinary output is increased in an attempt to decrease lung edema, shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, and improve survival. A possible risk of this approach is a decrease in cardiac output and worsening of nonpulmonary-organ function. The liberal fluid approach essentially reverses these potential priorities and risks.
Current evidence is insufficient to support the use of either a liberal or conservative fluid strategy in patients with established acute lung injury.8–11 We conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial to investigate the risks and benefits of a fluid-management protocol with a lower (conservative use of fluids) or higher (liberal use of fluids) intravascular pressure (as defined by the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure or central venous pressure) in patients with acute lung injury. Our primary outcome was death from any cause at 60 days.
Methods
Study Design
The complete protocol for this trial can be found in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). Patients were randomly assigned to a strategy involving either conservative or liberal use of fluids with concealed allocation in permuted blocks of eight with the use of an automated system. Participants were simultaneously randomly assigned to receive either a pulmonary-artery catheter or a central venous catheter in a two-by-two factorial design.12
Inclusion Criteria
Eligible patients were intubated and received positive-pressure ventilation, had a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 300 (adjusted if the altitude exceeded 1000 m), and had bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography consistent with the presence of pulmonary edema without evidence of left atrial hypertension.13 If a potential participant did not have a central venous catheter, the primary physician's intent to insert one was required.
Exclusion Criteria
Reasons for exclusion are listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Major reasons for exclusion were the presence of a pulmonary-artery catheter after the onset of acute lung injury; the presence of acute lung injury for more than 48 hours; inability to obtain consent; the presence of chronic conditions that could independently influence survival, impair weaning, or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., severe lung or neuromuscular disease or dependence on dialysis); and irreversible conditions for which the estimated six-month mortality rate exceeded 50 percent, such as advanced cancer.
Study Procedures
Ventilation according to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network protocol of lower tidal volumes was begun within one hour after randomization and continued until day 28; a protocol was used to wean patients from mechanical ventilation.14 The assigned catheter was inserted within four hours after randomization. Hemodynamic management was started within 2 hours after catheter insertion and continued for seven days or until 12 hours after a patient was able to breathe without assistance.14 After day 3, a pulmonary-artery catheter could be replaced by a central venous catheter if hemodynamic stability (i.e., absence of the need for protocol-directed interventions on the basis of a measurement with a pulmonary-artery catheter for more than 24 hours) was achieved. We monitored compliance with protocol instructions twice each day: once during a morning reference period and again at a randomly selected time. A 100 percent audit of all instructions conducted after the first 82 patients were enrolled showed rates of protocol compliance similar to those obtained during the random checks (data not shown).
Study personnel underwent training in the conduct of the protocol (Figure 1) and the measurement of vascular pressure. Vascular pressures were measured in supine patients at end expiration (identified with an airway pressure signal) but were not adjusted for airway pressure.15
Figure 1

Overview of the Protocol for Conservative and Liberal Fluid Management in the Group Assigned to a Pulmonary-Artery Catheter (PAC) and the Group Assigned to a Central Venous Catheter (CVC).
Subjects
A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute protocol-review committee, a data and safety monitoring board, and the institutional review board of each participating hospital approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from participants or legally authorized surrogates. The data and safety monitoring board conducted interim analyses after the enrollment of 82 patients and then after the enrollment of approximately every 200 patients. Sequential stopping rules for safety and efficacy used the method of O'Brien and Fleming.16
Organ Failure
For 28 days, we monitored patients daily for cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic failure; coagulation abnormalities; and the need for assisted ventilation.14 The severity of lung injury was scored according to the method of Murray et al.17; the scores can range from 0 to 4, with a lower score indicating better lung function.
Statistical Analysis
The study had a statistical power of 90 percent to detect a reduction by 10 percentage points (from 31 percent to 21 percent) in the primary end point, death before discharge home during the first 60 days after randomization, with the planned enrollment of 1000 patients. We assumed patients who went home without the use of assisted ventilation before day 60 were alive at 60 days. Data on patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or in a hospital were censored on the last day of follow-up. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the mean (±SE) 60-day mortality rate at the time of the last death that occurred before 60 days. Differences in mortality between the groups were assessed by a z test. The primary analysis was conducted according to the intention to treat. We assessed differences in continuous variables with analysis of variance, differences in categorical variables with a Mantel–Haenszel test, and differences between continuous variables over time with repeated-measures analysis of variance. For continuous variables, means ±SE are reported. Two-sided P values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance. We used SAS software (version 8.2, SAS Institute) for the analysis.
Results
Enrollment and Exclusions
We screened patients at 20 North American centers between June 8, 2000, and October 3, 2005. The trial was halted on July 25, 2002, for a review by the Office of Human Research Protection and resumed unchanged on July 23, 2003, except for the introduction of a modified consent form.18–20 Figure 2 shows the most common reasons for exclusion for the 10,511 patients who were screened but not enrolled and the follow-up for the 503 patients who were randomly assigned to conservative fluid management and the 498 who were assigned to liberal fluid management (all reasons for exclusion are listed in Table 1 of the Supplementary Appendix).

Enrollment and Outcomes.
Baseline Characteristics
The two groups were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, type of intensive care unit (ICU), cause of lung injury, coexisting illnesses, severity of illness, organ function, fluid balance before the study began, vasopressor use, and presence of shock (Table 1).
Table 1

Baseline Characteristics.
Protocol Conduct and Instructions
The mean time from admission to the ICU to the first protocol instruction was 41.3±1.6 hours in the liberal-strategy group and 43.8±2.5 hours in the conservative-strategy group (P=0.42). The rate of compliance with instructions was similar in the two groups (91 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 88 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.06), even though patients in the former group received more protocol instructions per day (5.1 vs. 4.1, P<0.001). Patients in the conservative-strategy group received furosemide more frequently than did patients in the liberal-strategy group (41 percent vs. 10 percent of instructions, P<0.001), whereas patients in the latter group more often received a fluid bolus (15 percent vs. 6 percent of instructions, P<0.001). More furosemide was given to the conservative-strategy group (Table 2). Dobutamine use was similar and uncommon in both groups (4 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 6 percent in the conservative-strategy group). At least one blood transfusion was given to 29 percent of patients in the conservative-strategy group and to 39 percent of patients in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). During the study, there was no significant difference in the use of drotrecogin alfa (19 percent in the conservative-strategy group vs. 21 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.70) or systemic corticosteroids (32 percent vs. 37 percent, P=0.09).
Table 2

Furosemide Dose, Fluid Intake, Fluid Output, and Fluid Balance on Each Day during the Study.
Fluid Balance
Each study day the liberal-strategy group received more fluid than the conservative-strategy group and on days 1 through 4 had a lower urinary output, resulting in a higher cumulative fluid balance (Table 2). During the study, the seven-day cumulative fluid balance was –136±491 ml in the conservative-strategy group, as compared with 6992±502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001) (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). For patients who were in shock at baseline, the cumulative seven-day fluid balance was 2904±1008 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 10,138±922 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). For patients who were not in shock at baseline, the cumulative fluid balance was −1576±519 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 5287±576 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001).
Hemodynamics
Intravascular pressures declined in the conservative-strategy group but remained essentially unchanged in the liberal-strategy group (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had a slightly lower mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index, but the heart rate, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and percentage of patients receiving vasopressors did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 2A in the Supplementary Appendix). For patients in shock at randomization, approximately 40 percent of subsequent measurements met the criteria for shock in both treatment groups. For patients who were not in shock at baseline, there were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of shock during study (32 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 28 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.29) or in the proportions of protocol reassessments classified as shock (6 percent and 7 percent, respectively; P=0.78).
Lung Function
Ventilator settings and lung-function data are shown in Table 2B of the Supplementary Appendix. The conservative-strategy group had better lung injury scores and oxygenation indexes, as well as lower plateau pressures and positive end-expiratory pressures. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and the PaO2:FiO2 were slightly higher in the conservative-strategy group on all study days, but this difference did not reach significance for the PaO2:FiO2 (P=0.07).
Metabolic and Renal Function
The conservative-strategy group had slightly higher creatinine values than the liberal-strategy group during the study, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.06) (Table 2C of the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, albumin, and calculated colloid osmotic pressure during the study.21 There were no significant differences in mean serum sodium levels during the study.
Safety
Metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalances were reported as an adverse event (none with associated arrhythmias) more frequently with the conservative strategy (42 events, 3 serious) than with the liberal strategy (19 events, 1 serious) (P=0.001). More patients in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group had at least one potassium value of 3.0 mmol per liter or less (26 percent vs. 22 percent, P<0.001), one sodium value of at least 150 mmol per liter (25 percent vs. 18 percent, P=0.009), or one bicarbonate value of more than 40 mmol per liter (6 percent vs. 2 percent, P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with at least one potassium value of 2.5 mmol per liter or less (4 percent vs. 3 percent, P=0.23).
Major Outcomes
Major outcomes are shown in Table 3 and Figure 3. There was no interaction between the interventions of the factorial design (type of fluid management and type of catheter, P=0.26). Therefore, results are reported according to the fluid-management strategy, irrespective of catheter assignment. The in-hospital death rate during the first 60 days after randomization was 25.5±1.9 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4±2.0 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, −2.6 to 8.4 percent). The conservative-strategy group had more ventilator-free days, days free of central nervous system failure, and ICU-free days during the first 28 days. There were no significant differences in the number of failure-free days for other organs during the first 28 days, although there was a small (0.3 day) increase in the number of cardiovascular-failure–free days during the first 7 days with the liberal strategy. Within the first 60 days, there were no significant differences in either the percentage of patients receiving renal-replacement therapy (10 percent in the conservative-strategy group vs. 14 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.06) or the average number of days of renal support (11.0±1.7 vs. 10.9±1.4, P=0.96). There were no significant interactions between baseline shock status and treatment with respect to the mortality rate or the number of ventilator-free days or ICU-free days (Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix).
Figure 3

Table 3

Main Outcome Variables.
Black patients had a higher overall rate of death (37.3 percent of 118 black patients in the liberal-strategy group and 31.3 percent of 99 black patients in the conservative-strategy group) than white patients (22.7 percent of 313 white patients in the liberal-strategy group and 23.5 percent of 328 white patients in the conservative-strategy group) (P=0.002). Hispanic patients also had a higher mortality rate (38.5 percent of 52 Hispanic patients in the liberal-strategy group and 23.0 percent of 61 Hispanic patients in the conservative-strategy group) than whites, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.10). After adjustment for baseline covariates, the hazard ratio for death among blacks as compared with whites was not significant (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.73), whereas it was significant for Hispanics (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.31). The interaction between treatment and race for whites as compared with nonwhites was not significant (P=0.10), nor was it significant in any of the racial or ethnic subgroups. There was also no significant interaction between treatment and sex.
Discussion
Although we did not detect a significant difference between the conservative strategy and the liberal strategy of fluid management in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. The overall difference in mortality according to race or ethnic group has previously been described in patients with acute lung injury22 and could be due to several factors, including socioeconomic disparities or genetic determinants.23
The two strategies were designed to be prudent but distinctly different approaches to fluid therapy. To place the results of our study in context, it is useful to consider how these fluid strategies compare with usual practice. In this regard, it is of interest that the cumulative seven-day fluid balance in the liberal-strategy group (6992±502 ml) was similar to that among patients in ARDS Network studies in which the approach to fluid management was not specified14,24 (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). These findings are similar to those reported by Simmons et al.8 in 1987, suggesting that the liberal approach to fluid management reflects long-standing practices. The usual practice resembles the liberal approach in another aspect: the prestudy baseline measurements for central venous pressure (12.2 mm Hg) and pulmonary-artery–occlusion pressure (15.7 mm Hg) were both within the target ranges for the liberal fluid strategy (10 to 14 mm Hg and 14 to 18 mm Hg, respectively).
Comparisons of our study to other studies of goal-directed management in critically ill patients are problematic because of differences in protocols, patient populations, and timing of the interventions. Whereas we targeted central venous pressure or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure in patients with recent onset of acute lung injury, previous studies targeted the cardiac index, oxygen delivery, or mixed venous oxygen saturation in heterogeneous populations of critically ill patients.25–31 Rivers et al.32 demonstrated in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock the efficacy of six hours of early, goal-directed resuscitation in the emergency department before admission to the ICU. In contrast, our patients received their first protocol intervention an average of 43 hours after admission to the ICU and 24 hours after meeting the criteria for acute lung injury.
The conservative-strategy group had higher serum oncotic pressures and lower intravascular pressures — characteristics that would be expected to limit the development of pulmonary edema. With lung injury, small increases in the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure are associated with large increases in extravascular lung water.2 The higher albumin and hemoglobin levels in the conservative-strategy group appear to be primarily related to hemoconcentration (or less hemodilution), since the rate of albumin use was low and not significantly different between groups and red-cell transfusions were more frequent in the liberal-strategy group.
Our results are consistent with those obtained in studies in animals suggesting improved lung function with diuretics and fluid restriction33–37 and with the results of observational studies in humans indicating increased survival with a lower fluid balance and a reduction in the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure.6,8,9 Mitchell and colleagues10 randomly assigned 89 patients with pulmonary edema to receive diuretics and fluid restriction based on extravascular lung water or routine fluid management; the group with fluid restriction had a lower fluid balance, fewer days of ventilator use, and fewer days in the ICU. Martin and coworkers11 randomly assigned 37 patients with hypoproteinemia and acute lung injury to receive either a five-day specified regimen of furosemide and colloid replacement or placebo infusions. The treated group had an increase in the PaO2:FiO2 within 24 hours. We do not know whether using lung-water measurements to drive protocol instructions or increasing the use of colloid would have increased the benefits of the conservative strategy in our study.
The hemodynamic consequences of the conservative strategy were small and apparently of minimal clinical significance. Although the mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index were slightly lower in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group, there were no significant differences in mixed venous oxygenation or in the incidence or duration of shock. Although the conservative strategy was associated with a slightly higher blood urea nitrogen level, the creatinine level, the number of days without renal failure, and the need for dialysis were similar in the two groups. Possible reasons for the greater number of days without central nervous system failure in the conservative-strategy group include a reduced incidence of cerebral edema, differences in acid–base status, or a lower rate of use of sedation as improved lung function permitted earlier removal from the ventilator. The available data are not sufficient to distinguish among these or other potential explanations.
The protocols were designed to minimize risks. During shock, physicians treated patients according to their usual practice. Because of concern that a conservative approach might worsen cardiovascular or renal function, diuretic administration was suspended until 12 hours after a fluid bolus or the reversal of shock, and prompt fluid administration was provided in the event of oliguria or ineffective circulation. Diuretic therapy was titrated on the basis of the patient's response, avoided in patients with worsening renal function, and limited to a daily maximum. To minimize the risk of excessive fluid therapy, protocol-mandated fluid administration in patients without shock was limited to three boluses per day and was withheld in patients without shock who had severe hypoxemia (FiO2≥0.7) or a cardiac index of at least 4.5 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area.
Electrolyte levels were managed by the clinician. The conservative-strategy group had a higher partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and bicarbonate level than did the liberal-strategy group. Although mean differences between the groups in the serum sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels were small, a higher percentage of patients in the conservative-strategy group had at least one potassium value between 2.5 and 3.0 mmol per liter, at least one sodium value of 150 mmol per liter or more, and at least one bicarbonate value of 40 mmol per liter or more. Hence, close monitoring of electrolyte levels is warranted during diuretic therapy.
Since we tested specific management strategies that used several variables and safeguards, we do not know whether the safety and benefit of the conservative protocol could be realized by using the simplified target of a zero fluid balance. Departures from the specific hemodynamic and ventilator protocols used in this trial may lead to clinical outcomes that differ from those observed in this study.
In conclusion, we found that use of a conservative fluid-management protocol with a lower central venous pressure or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure target resulted in a major reduction in net fluid balance without an increase in adverse events, as compared with a liberal fluid-management protocol targeting higher intravascular filling pressures. Although we did not detect a difference in the mortality rate between the two approaches, the conservative strategy improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care, without increasing nonpulmonary organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury.
",0.86196697,"The provided background information focuses on fluid management in patients with acute lung injury, comparing a conservative strategy with a liberal strategy. However, it does not provide information related to the use of continuous neuromuscular blockade, such as cisatracurium, in the context of light sedation protocols for patients with moderate to severe ARDS. Therefore, the information needed to directly answer the question about the early use of continuous neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium improving mortality in ARDS with light sedation protocols is not available within the provided text.

The management of ARDS often involves various treatment strategies, including mechanical ventilation strategies (e.g., low tidal volume ventilation), fluid management as discussed, and potentially the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) like cisatracurium. NMBAs can be used in ARDS to facilitate mechanical ventilation and potentially improve oxygenation and patient outcomes when used appropriately, often in conjunction with light sedation to prevent patient-ventilator asynchrony, reduce oxygen consumption, and improve airway pressures.

To comprehensively answer the question about the impact of early continuous neuromuscular blockade on mortality in ARDS patients using light sedation protocols, additional specific clinical trial data or meta-analyses focusing on that particular intervention would be necessary. Studies such as the ACURASYS and ROSE trials have assessed NMBA use in ARDS, but it's crucial to look at specific trials to determine if there are benefits on mortality within current practice sedation protocols.",0.

As compared with the liberal strategy, the conservative strategy improved the oxygenation index ([mean airway pressure×the ratio of the fraction of inspired oxygen to the partial pressure of arterial oxygen]×100) and the lung injury score and increased the number of ventilator-free days (14.6±0.5 vs. 12.1±0.5, P<0.001) and days not spent in the intensive care unit (13.4±0.4 vs. 11.2±0.4, P<0.001) during the first 28 days but did not increase the incidence or prevalence of shock during the study or the use of dialysis during the first 60 days (10 percent vs. 14 percent, P=0.06).
Conclusions
Although there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy of fluid management improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00281268.)
Pulmonary edema resulting from increased capillary permeability, a hallmark of acute lung injury, worsens as intravascular hydrostatic pressure rises and oncotic pressure falls.1,2 Although lung failure alone can be lethal, death in patients with acute lung injury is usually due to the failure of nonpulmonary organs.1,3
The optimal fluid management of acute lung injury is not settled.4–7 The usual practice is wide-ranging, and many practitioners weigh the risks and benefits of strategies of conservative as compared with liberal fluid management. In the conservative approach, fluid intake is restricted and urinary output is increased in an attempt to decrease lung edema, shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation, and improve survival. A possible risk of this approach is a decrease in cardiac output and worsening of nonpulmonary-organ function. The liberal fluid approach essentially reverses these potential priorities and risks.
Current evidence is insufficient to support the use of either a liberal or conservative fluid strategy in patients with established acute lung injury.8–11 We conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial to investigate the risks and benefits of a fluid-management protocol with a lower (conservative use of fluids) or higher (liberal use of fluids) intravascular pressure (as defined by the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure or central venous pressure) in patients with acute lung injury. Our primary outcome was death from any cause at 60 days.
Methods
Study Design
The complete protocol for this trial can be found in the Supplementary Appendix (available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). Patients were randomly assigned to a strategy involving either conservative or liberal use of fluids with concealed allocation in permuted blocks of eight with the use of an automated system. Participants were simultaneously randomly assigned to receive either a pulmonary-artery catheter or a central venous catheter in a two-by-two factorial design.12
Inclusion Criteria
Eligible patients were intubated and received positive-pressure ventilation, had a ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 300 (adjusted if the altitude exceeded 1000 m), and had bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography consistent with the presence of pulmonary edema without evidence of left atrial hypertension.13 If a potential participant did not have a central venous catheter, the primary physician's intent to insert one was required.
Exclusion Criteria
Reasons for exclusion are listed in the Supplementary Appendix. Major reasons for exclusion were the presence of a pulmonary-artery catheter after the onset of acute lung injury; the presence of acute lung injury for more than 48 hours; inability to obtain consent; the presence of chronic conditions that could independently influence survival, impair weaning, or compromise compliance with the protocol (e.g., severe lung or neuromuscular disease or dependence on dialysis); and irreversible conditions for which the estimated six-month mortality rate exceeded 50 percent, such as advanced cancer.
Study Procedures
Ventilation according to the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network protocol of lower tidal volumes was begun within one hour after randomization and continued until day 28; a protocol was used to wean patients from mechanical ventilation.14 The assigned catheter was inserted within four hours after randomization. Hemodynamic management was started within 2 hours after catheter insertion and continued for seven days or until 12 hours after a patient was able to breathe without assistance.14 After day 3, a pulmonary-artery catheter could be replaced by a central venous catheter if hemodynamic stability (i.e., absence of the need for protocol-directed interventions on the basis of a measurement with a pulmonary-artery catheter for more than 24 hours) was achieved. We monitored compliance with protocol instructions twice each day: once during a morning reference period and again at a randomly selected time. A 100 percent audit of all instructions conducted after the first 82 patients were enrolled showed rates of protocol compliance similar to those obtained during the random checks (data not shown).
Study personnel underwent training in the conduct of the protocol (Figure 1) and the measurement of vascular pressure. Vascular pressures were measured in supine patients at end expiration (identified with an airway pressure signal) but were not adjusted for airway pressure.15

Subjects
A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute protocol-review committee, a data and safety monitoring board, and the institutional review board of each participating hospital approved the study. Written informed consent was obtained from participants or legally authorized surrogates. The data and safety monitoring board conducted interim analyses after the enrollment of 82 patients and then after the enrollment of approximately every 200 patients. Sequential stopping rules for safety and efficacy used the method of O'Brien and Fleming.16
Organ Failure
For 28 days, we monitored patients daily for cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic failure; coagulation abnormalities; and the need for assisted ventilation.14 The severity of lung injury was scored according to the method of Murray et al.17; the scores can range from 0 to 4, with a lower score indicating better lung function.
Statistical Analysis
The study had a statistical power of 90 percent to detect a reduction by 10 percentage points (from 31 percent to 21 percent) in the primary end point, death before discharge home during the first 60 days after randomization, with the planned enrollment of 1000 patients. We assumed patients who went home without the use of assisted ventilation before day 60 were alive at 60 days. Data on patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation or in a hospital were censored on the last day of follow-up. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the mean (±SE) 60-day mortality rate at the time of the last death that occurred before 60 days. Differences in mortality between the groups were assessed by a z test. The primary analysis was conducted according to the intention to treat. We assessed differences in continuous variables with analysis of variance, differences in categorical variables with a Mantel–Haenszel test, and differences between continuous variables over time with repeated-measures analysis of variance. For continuous variables, means ±SE are reported. Two-sided P values of 0.05 or less were considered to indicate statistical significance. We used SAS software (version 8.2, SAS Institute) for the analysis.
Results
Enrollment and Exclusions
We screened patients at 20 North American centers between June 8, 2000, and October 3, 2005. The trial was halted on July 25, 2002, for a review by the Office of Human Research Protection and resumed unchanged on July 23, 2003, except for the introduction of a modified consent form.18–20 Figure 2 shows the most common reasons for exclusion for the 10,511 patients who were screened but not enrolled and the follow-up for the 503 patients who were randomly assigned to conservative fluid management and the 498 who were assigned to liberal fluid management (all reasons for exclusion are listed in Table 1 of the Supplementary Appendix).

Enrollment and Outcomes.
Baseline Characteristics
The two groups were similar with respect to demographic characteristics, type of intensive care unit (ICU), cause of lung injury, coexisting illnesses, severity of illness, organ function, fluid balance before the study began, vasopressor use, and presence of shock (Table 1).
Table 1

Baseline Characteristics.
Protocol Conduct and Instructions
The mean time from admission to the ICU to the first protocol instruction was 41.3±1.6 hours in the liberal-strategy group and 43.8±2.5 hours in the conservative-strategy group (P=0.42). The rate of compliance with instructions was similar in the two groups (91 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 88 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.06), even though patients in the former group received more protocol instructions per day (5.1 vs. 4.1, P<0.001). Patients in the conservative-strategy group received furosemide more frequently than did patients in the liberal-strategy group (41 percent vs. 10 percent of instructions, P<0.001), whereas patients in the latter group more often received a fluid bolus (15 percent vs. 6 percent of instructions, P<0.001). More furosemide was given to the conservative-strategy group (Table 2). Dobutamine use was similar and uncommon in both groups (4 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 6 percent in the conservative-strategy group). At least one blood transfusion was given to 29 percent of patients in the conservative-strategy group and to 39 percent of patients in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). During the study, there was no significant difference in the use of drotrecogin alfa (19 percent in the conservative-strategy group vs. 21 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.70) or systemic corticosteroids (32 percent vs. 37 percent, P=0.09).
Table 2

Furosemide Dose, Fluid Intake, Fluid Output, and Fluid Balance on Each Day during the Study.
Fluid Balance
Each study day the liberal-strategy group received more fluid than the conservative-strategy group and on days 1 through 4 had a lower urinary output, resulting in a higher cumulative fluid balance (Table 2). During the study, the seven-day cumulative fluid balance was –136±491 ml in the conservative-strategy group, as compared with 6992±502 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001) (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). For patients who were in shock at baseline, the cumulative seven-day fluid balance was 2904±1008 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 10,138±922 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). For patients who were not in shock at baseline, the cumulative fluid balance was −1576±519 ml in the conservative-strategy group and 5287±576 ml in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001).
Hemodynamics
Intravascular pressures declined in the conservative-strategy group but remained essentially unchanged in the liberal-strategy group (Figure 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had a slightly lower mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index, but the heart rate, mixed venous oxygen saturation, and percentage of patients receiving vasopressors did not differ significantly between the two groups (Table 2A in the Supplementary Appendix). For patients in shock at randomization, approximately 40 percent of subsequent measurements met the criteria for shock in both treatment groups. For patients who were not in shock at baseline, there were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of shock during study (32 percent in the liberal-strategy group and 28 percent in the conservative-strategy group, P=0.29) or in the proportions of protocol reassessments classified as shock (6 percent and 7 percent, respectively; P=0.78).
Lung Function
Ventilator settings and lung-function data are shown in Table 2B of the Supplementary Appendix. The conservative-strategy group had better lung injury scores and oxygenation indexes, as well as lower plateau pressures and positive end-expiratory pressures. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and the PaO2:FiO2 were slightly higher in the conservative-strategy group on all study days, but this difference did not reach significance for the PaO2:FiO2 (P=0.07).
Metabolic and Renal Function
The conservative-strategy group had slightly higher creatinine values than the liberal-strategy group during the study, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.06) (Table 2C of the Supplementary Appendix). The conservative-strategy group had higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, albumin, and calculated colloid osmotic pressure during the study.21 There were no significant differences in mean serum sodium levels during the study.
Safety
Metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte imbalances were reported as an adverse event (none with associated arrhythmias) more frequently with the conservative strategy (42 events, 3 serious) than with the liberal strategy (19 events, 1 serious) (P=0.001). More patients in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group had at least one potassium value of 3.0 mmol per liter or less (26 percent vs. 22 percent, P<0.001), one sodium value of at least 150 mmol per liter (25 percent vs. 18 percent, P=0.009), or one bicarbonate value of more than 40 mmol per liter (6 percent vs. 2 percent, P<0.001). There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with at least one potassium value of 2.5 mmol per liter or less (4 percent vs. 3 percent, P=0.23).
Major Outcomes
Major outcomes are shown in Table 3 and Figure 3. There was no interaction between the interventions of the factorial design (type of fluid management and type of catheter, P=0.26). Therefore, results are reported according to the fluid-management strategy, irrespective of catheter assignment. The in-hospital death rate during the first 60 days after randomization was 25.5±1.9 percent in the conservative-strategy group and 28.4±2.0 percent in the liberal-strategy group (P=0.30; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference, −2.6 to 8.4 percent). The conservative-strategy group had more ventilator-free days, days free of central nervous system failure, and ICU-free days during the first 28 days. There were no significant differences in the number of failure-free days for other organs during the first 28 days, although there was a small (0.3 day) increase in the number of cardiovascular-failure–free days during the first 7 days with the liberal strategy. Within the first 60 days, there were no significant differences in either the percentage of patients receiving renal-replacement therapy (10 percent in the conservative-strategy group vs. 14 percent in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.06) or the average number of days of renal support (11.0±1.7 vs. 10.9±1.4, P=0.96). There were no significant interactions between baseline shock status and treatment with respect to the mortality rate or the number of ventilator-free days or ICU-free days (Table 3 of the Supplementary Appendix).

Main Outcome Variables.
Black patients had a higher overall rate of death (37.3 percent of 118 black patients in the liberal-strategy group and 31.3 percent of 99 black patients in the conservative-strategy group) than white patients (22.7 percent of 313 white patients in the liberal-strategy group and 23.5 percent of 328 white patients in the conservative-strategy group) (P=0.002). Hispanic patients also had a higher mortality rate (38.5 percent of 52 Hispanic patients in the liberal-strategy group and 23.0 percent of 61 Hispanic patients in the conservative-strategy group) than whites, but this difference did not reach significance (P=0.10). After adjustment for baseline covariates, the hazard ratio for death among blacks as compared with whites was not significant (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.97 to 1.73), whereas it was significant for Hispanics (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.08 to 2.31). The interaction between treatment and race for whites as compared with nonwhites was not significant (P=0.10), nor was it significant in any of the racial or ethnic subgroups. There was also no significant interaction between treatment and sex.
Discussion
Although we did not detect a significant difference between the conservative strategy and the liberal strategy of fluid management in the primary outcome of 60-day mortality, the conservative strategy improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care without increasing nonpulmonary-organ failures. The overall difference in mortality according to race or ethnic group has previously been described in patients with acute lung injury22 and could be due to several factors, including socioeconomic disparities or genetic determinants.23
The two strategies were designed to be prudent but distinctly different approaches to fluid therapy. To place the results of our study in context, it is useful to consider how these fluid strategies compare with usual practice. In this regard, it is of interest that the cumulative seven-day fluid balance in the liberal-strategy group (6992±502 ml) was similar to that among patients in ARDS Network studies in which the approach to fluid management was not specified14,24 (Figure 1 of the Supplementary Appendix). These findings are similar to those reported by Simmons et al.8 in 1987, suggesting that the liberal approach to fluid management reflects long-standing practices. The usual practice resembles the liberal approach in another aspect: the prestudy baseline measurements for central venous pressure (12.2 mm Hg) and pulmonary-artery–occlusion pressure (15.7 mm Hg) were both within the target ranges for the liberal fluid strategy (10 to 14 mm Hg and 14 to 18 mm Hg, respectively).
Comparisons of our study to other studies of goal-directed management in critically ill patients are problematic because of differences in protocols, patient populations, and timing of the interventions. Whereas we targeted central venous pressure or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure in patients with recent onset of acute lung injury, previous studies targeted the cardiac index, oxygen delivery, or mixed venous oxygen saturation in heterogeneous populations of critically ill patients.25–31 Rivers et al.32 demonstrated in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock the efficacy of six hours of early, goal-directed resuscitation in the emergency department before admission to the ICU. In contrast, our patients received their first protocol intervention an average of 43 hours after admission to the ICU and 24 hours after meeting the criteria for acute lung injury.
The conservative-strategy group had higher serum oncotic pressures and lower intravascular pressures — characteristics that would be expected to limit the development of pulmonary edema. With lung injury, small increases in the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure are associated with large increases in extravascular lung water.2 The higher albumin and hemoglobin levels in the conservative-strategy group appear to be primarily related to hemoconcentration (or less hemodilution), since the rate of albumin use was low and not significantly different between groups and red-cell transfusions were more frequent in the liberal-strategy group.
Our results are consistent with those obtained in studies in animals suggesting improved lung function with diuretics and fluid restriction33–37 and with the results of observational studies in humans indicating increased survival with a lower fluid balance and a reduction in the pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure.6,8,9 Mitchell and colleagues10 randomly assigned 89 patients with pulmonary edema to receive diuretics and fluid restriction based on extravascular lung water or routine fluid management; the group with fluid restriction had a lower fluid balance, fewer days of ventilator use, and fewer days in the ICU. Martin and coworkers11 randomly assigned 37 patients with hypoproteinemia and acute lung injury to receive either a five-day specified regimen of furosemide and colloid replacement or placebo infusions. The treated group had an increase in the PaO2:FiO2 within 24 hours. We do not know whether using lung-water measurements to drive protocol instructions or increasing the use of colloid would have increased the benefits of the conservative strategy in our study.
The hemodynamic consequences of the conservative strategy were small and apparently of minimal clinical significance. Although the mean arterial pressure, stroke volume, and cardiac index were slightly lower in the conservative-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group, there were no significant differences in mixed venous oxygenation or in the incidence or duration of shock. Although the conservative strategy was associated with a slightly higher blood urea nitrogen level, the creatinine level, the number of days without renal failure, and the need for dialysis were similar in the two groups. Possible reasons for the greater number of days without central nervous system failure in the conservative-strategy group include a reduced incidence of cerebral edema, differences in acid–base status, or a lower rate of use of sedation as improved lung function permitted earlier removal from the ventilator. The available data are not sufficient to distinguish among these or other potential explanations.
The protocols were designed to minimize risks. During shock, physicians treated patients according to their usual practice. Because of concern that a conservative approach might worsen cardiovascular or renal function, diuretic administration was suspended until 12 hours after a fluid bolus or the reversal of shock, and prompt fluid administration was provided in the event of oliguria or ineffective circulation. Diuretic therapy was titrated on the basis of the patient's response, avoided in patients with worsening renal function, and limited to a daily maximum. To minimize the risk of excessive fluid therapy, protocol-mandated fluid administration in patients without shock was limited to three boluses per day and was withheld in patients without shock who had severe hypoxemia (FiO2≥0.7) or a cardiac index of at least 4.5 liters per minute per square meter of body-surface area.
Electrolyte levels were managed by the clinician. The conservative-strategy group had a higher partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, arterial pH, and bicarbonate level than did the liberal-strategy group. Although mean differences between the groups in the serum sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels were small, a higher percentage of patients in the conservative-strategy group had at least one potassium value between 2.5 and 3.0 mmol per liter, at least one sodium value of 150 mmol per liter or more, and at least one bicarbonate value of 40 mmol per liter or more. Hence, close monitoring of electrolyte levels is warranted during diuretic therapy.
Since we tested specific management strategies that used several variables and safeguards, we do not know whether the safety and benefit of the conservative protocol could be realized by using the simplified target of a zero fluid balance. Departures from the specific hemodynamic and ventilator protocols used in this trial may lead to clinical outcomes that differ from those observed in this study.
In conclusion, we found that use of a conservative fluid-management protocol with a lower central venous pressure or pulmonary-artery occlusion pressure target resulted in a major reduction in net fluid balance without an increase in adverse events, as compared with a liberal fluid-management protocol targeting higher intravascular filling pressures. Although we did not detect a difference in the mortality rate between the two approaches, the conservative strategy improved lung function and shortened the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care, without increasing nonpulmonary organ failures. These results support the use of a conservative strategy of fluid management in patients with acute lung injury.
",0.86196697,"The provided information does not directly address the question about the early use of continuous neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium and its impact on mortality in patients with moderate to severe ARDS using current light sedation protocols. Instead, the text focuses on a study comparing conservative and liberal fluid management strategies in patients with acute lung injury, not directly involving neuromuscular blockade or cisatracurium.

To answer the question about cisatracurium, it is necessary to refer to other studies or clinical guidelines specifically investigating neuromuscular blockade in ARDS. According to some key studies, early use of neuromuscular blocking agents like cisatracurium in ARDS patients, especially when deep sedation is needed as part of lung-protective ventilation strategies, can improve outcomes such as oxygenation and may reduce mortality under specific circumstances. However, as sedation protocols evolve towards lighter sedation, the application and benefits of continuous neuromuscular blockade might vary. Therefore, while evidence suggests potential benefits, exact outcomes would depend on the patient population, clinical setting, and adherence to protocols.

For a precise answer regarding its impact with light sedation, reviewing specific studies or guidelines on neuromuscular blockades like cisatracurium in the context of evolving sedation protocols would be necessary.",0.
